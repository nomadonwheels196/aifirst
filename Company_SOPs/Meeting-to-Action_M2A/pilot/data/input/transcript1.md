00:00:30 Speaker 1 
蜜蜂蜜蜂蜜蜂 蜜蜂.
00:02:30 Speaker 1 
最高峰時的高度約是1.5米。
00:03:45 Travis 
Hey, hey, hold on, microphone would probably help. Can you hear me? Yeah, yes. How's it going, man? So I was just sending you a note. I realized that when I sent you the original note, I put an invite on my calendar, but I was like, oh, I don't know where to send it to. And then I just realized I didn't send you the meeting info. And then I realized I don't have your phone number. So I guess I need to get your number.
00:04:16 Speaker 3 
Let me just send it through, otherwise I'll forget.
00:04:20 Travis 
How are you. 
00:04:23 Speaker 3 
Busy, but good. How are you. 
00:04:25 Travis 
I'm doing awesome, man. Yeah, it's been, I don't know, it's been a crazy couple of months. Um, but you know, I mean, from a personal standpoint, um, everything's going good, you know, married life's fantastic. Um, uh, my, my step-mom has had some, some health issues lately, but I, you know, hopefully she'll pull through. Um, and yeah, I mean, and then trying to, to build a new company, um, which, you know, I, I had almost forgotten what it was like to get up every.
00:05:00 Travis 
morning and be like crazy excited about what you do. Um, you know, I mean, I don't be wrong. I, I loved, you know, I loved my time at Zscaler. I worked with amazing people. Um, you know, but, Zscaler today I think is different than Zscaler six years ago, whatever, whenever I started, you know, and I think it's probably different even than a couple of years ago, whenever a lot of people started, but. You know, it's been super exciting. And, you know, and well, so I guess probably last time I talked to you,
00:05:33 Travis 
you know, I had been working with a buddy on like a breast cancer startup, you know, and we we sort of reached a point where I said, look, you know, dude, I love this, I love the mission, I love what we're doing. But eventually I was kind of like, we're not exactly moving at the pace that I had envisioned us moving. You know, I mean, he's got a family and I don't know, it was all good, you know. But I was like, OK, I started having brainstorming ideas.
00:06:04 Travis 
I was like, you know, I think there's something else I actually want to go work on myself. And so, yeah, I don't know, a month or so ago, I started working on that. I found a partner. So building an AI business, right, like everyone else, I guess. But, you know, I found I found a guy, a friend of a friend who has been working like in actually working in the AI space for quite a while, like doing consulting and training and all kinds of.
00:06:35 Travis 
stuff, you know, and so he's already billing, I don't know, 250k a year, you know, just consulting and enablement. But it's just him, you know, so I mean, he doesn't really have any expenses. It's pretty good business. But, you know, he's like, Travis, I can't scale. He's like, I need a way to scale. And, you know, and well, I had already been thinking about, you know, I'll get into it, you know, in a minute or whatever, but I've already been thinking about certain very similar things. And so I said, dude, let's let's go see if we can build this,
00:07:06 Travis 
you know, see if it works and have some fun. And, you know, if not, like, you know, we can both go back and get day jobs one day. But wouldn't it be nice, you know, after four or five years, you know, to to be a couple of hundred million dollars richer? You know, I can't do that, you know, in 10 years from now. I don't think I'd feel comfortable doing that right. But right now, if it works great, if it doesn't, you know, it's no big deal. So I'm excited, you know, long, long answer. But, yeah, nice. Really good. How about you? Has a has a family, has everything else going. 
00:07:41 Speaker 3 
For me, it's good. I mean, I got a daughter a couple of months ago, four and a half months ago. Yeah. Well, it's two now. It's more than doubling. It feels like double the kids in terms of pure numbers. But.
00:07:55 Travis 
But are you, I mean, I don't have any kids, so I don't exactly know, but I mean, are you at that age where you're sleeping or not? Is it like, you know, somebody staying up all night to take care. 
00:08:11 Speaker 3 
No, the bigger one sleeps fairly well until six, hopefully, so that's fine. And the little one is still breastfeeding, so not my job.
00:08:23 Travis 
Mark messing it up, yeah.
00:08:26 Speaker 3 
Exactly, so that's easy. Zizka, as you said, is different. Most of the people that joined when I joined or when you joined, I mean, they're just not there anymore. Also, you probably heard about Yard. Yeah. Also, an interesting move with this. Let's be all, let's focus the power on the sales, because... if someone knows what to do then it's sales or so they say okay sure oh man yeah no i i was.
00:09:07 Travis 
i was talking to uh to nils the other day and uh uh you know he you know we we started just talking about ai and he was telling me about the ai day launch day or whatever they did you know a little while back he's like travis was like i have never seen such a big show in my life i was like i can't say i'm surprised but you know i mean given that that's like my every day right now you know it justifies everything that i'm working towards so.
00:09:37 Travis 
i was like okay thumbs up for that that's yeah i hate to say it but i mean that's what i like to hear because that's what i'm trying to build a business off of so interesting because everyone.
00:09:47 Speaker 3 
is trying to do something but nobody seems to know what to do exactly with this ai thing, you, I think the best thing I've heard so far within Zscaler at least is training using time log series as large language models so that you can factor in time and not just, you know, a point in time and then using those on log data to help SOCs identify issues backwards. But that's still not the thing where you say, that's it.
00:10:18 Travis 
So it's interesting, right? You know, and honestly, this is kind of why I wanted to talk to you because I mean, your PhD was in like big data, something along those lines, right. 
00:10:32 Speaker 3 
In combinatorics, extreme and probabilistic combinatorics, some foundations of machine learning, but the theory part of it. And for me, this big data was always boring because it's just linear algebra. Mathematically, that wasn't super interesting.
00:10:51 Travis 
The so so, you know, what I I guess what I find, like, I always try to take a step back and I'm like, OK, what do I believe? Right. And, you know, where I think people are kind of getting it wrong is I personally believe in people, in human beings. I think human beings are creative. We, you know, have personal motivations which can cause, you know, can enable us to overcome, you know, what appear to be insurmountable challenges.
00:11:26 Travis 
And humans are really good at the what needs to happen and why, you know, whereas I think AI is really good at the, you know, how should I go about this? And then the execution. And and I think that's where, you know, a lot of people are really missing it. Right. You know, they're. you know, and all my customers right now, you know, are saying more or less the same thing. They're like, look, you know, we're looking for that killer use case, that thing. And I'm like,
00:11:58 Travis 
so you at an executive level are not the person who's going to identify the, and it's not a killer use case. There's going to be, you know, 8 billion killer use cases. And every one of them is going to be a little bit different because every company, every team, every problem is a little bit different. and so you know my my strategy right is is instead of focusing on you know and don't get me wrong, there's companies out there i think that are doing a great job of identifying certain use cases that.
00:12:33 Travis 
are somewhat scalable and they'll do great right but if we want this to work at scale i i think it boils down to enabling like human machine communication and collaboration like that that's really the key and so you know so you know so my my you know my partner like i said you know today so he he does a lot of classes for like the spanish government um especially like research scientists and all that sort of stuff.
00:13:03 Travis 
And so, you know, they pull them out of their research, their day job, or he's got pharmaceutical companies and sales teams, you know, all kinds of people. But imagine a sales team, you know, let's say you recognize that you need your sales team to be better at working with AI. So you pull them out of the field for even more enablement on top of all the other crap they have to do. Now they're not selling, they're going to get frustrated, they're going to sit in this class for a week and work on emails half the time. They're going to retain, you know, 10, 15%,
00:13:34 Travis 
whatever it is. And, you know, and then they're going to go back and they're going to say, you know, they're going to try it once and not get the result they expect. And they're going to screw this. I'm going to do it the same way I've always done it. That's just human nature. Right. And so, you know, I started working with him and I said, you know, what if we could. Drop an agent, you know right on somebody's desktop or on their mobile device or whatever that, Could sort of you know coach them as they actually do their day-to-day work, you know.
00:14:06 Travis 
I mean I start with with a low-hanging fruit the really easy stuff like, you know Whenever somebody opens up PowerPoint and starts actually creating a PowerPoint deck you say no, no, You know if you just start by kind of observing for the first week or two, you can say hey, In the last two weeks you spent eight hours building PowerPoint decks or you know Pulling content from other people's decks and trying to combine stuff and you could say, Wouldn't it be great if you could just let a I kind of get you 80 90% of the way there.
00:14:36 Travis 
Let me show you what the best, Practices the tools that are approved by your company are and guide you through this process, right? You know now then if you can build that tool that can identify, you know patterns, people do and you know processes and tools they use and so forth and identify build kind of a library of best practices and you know and what are the best tools today because it's impossible to keep up and I'm doing this full-time.
00:15:09 Travis 
right now and it's impossible for me to keep up with whatever the best tools are that are out there changes every week, And so if you have something that just lives on your desktop, you know, and I envision, do you remember Clippy? I don't know if you're old enough. So I envisioned it like Clippy, you know, the little smiley face there saying, you know, Hey, I'm just here to help. You know, imagine a little agent like that, that can see kind of, you know, what you're working on, and, and, and just make recommendations to help you get better at the human AI collaboration,
00:15:41 Travis 
not something that replaces all those tools, right? I'm not going to replace Chad to BT or co-pilot or whatever, you know, but instead just helps you to a, you know, change that mindset to think AI first, and then B to figure out how do I get the best results from whatever the best tools and methodologies are that are out there. And so that's, that's what we're building. And, you know, you, you came to mind and I said, you know what, I know somebody that might be interested in, in doing something like this.
00:16:13 Speaker 3 
So is it essentially like a high-level AI coach helping you using AI, right? Just let me kind of speak out loud, because what do people do when they use AI? They use it to summarize a call? I'm not sure if AI is the right use case, but they do.
00:16:36 Travis 
Well, so let's go through some of your examples, right? Because this is how this started, is I literally just sat down next to people and I watched, what are they doing today? And I was like, there's so many better ways of doing something, right? So let's say you join a call, okay? So you go to a customer call and from that customer call, let's say that you go with one of your SEs. So you got a sales guy, an SE, and then you're there as well.
00:17:07 Travis 
From that one customer call, you may identify some coaching opportunity for your SE. You may identify some feature request or platform issue the customer brings up. You're going to gain information about where they're at in their sales process, the things that are important to them, okay? And then under normal circumstances, what would you do? sit down afterwards, you'd review your notes, you'd figure out like, well, you know, yeah,
00:17:38 Travis 
they have this problem with the platform, but I don't have time to deal with that and it's not gonna impact them buying anything. So I'm not gonna do anything with that. Maybe you remember to kind of mention, you know, the coaching thing, but, you know, you mentioned it once, you know, how do you follow up on it? Do you follow up on it? Maybe, maybe not, is this a pattern or was it a one-off thing, right? You know, you have all this information about, you know, the customer call in your notes, but the sales guy has some other notes and your SE has some more notes and so forth, right?
00:18:11 Travis 
What if you could, you know, whenever you see something like that happen, you say, okay, I recognize that I could be doing a better way of handling this, right? And so you sit down, you know, with whatever, ChadGBT or something that's approved, and you say, okay, I want you, you know, we're gonna develop a. an agent that every time I go to a call and I record the call, I want you to get that.
00:18:45 Travis 
transcript and I want you to analyze it for coaching opportunities, for customer problems, feature requests, and for customer or sales information, and I want you to automatically drop those into Markdown files, and then you have another agent that goes and pulls that and you have a coaching agent, and so from every meeting you go to, it goes and it looks in your coaching folder for the specific person and it says, okay, I'm going to collect all.
00:19:17 Travis 
of these coaching observations from all the different meetings, analyze those, and now I have a... you know something that says here's what this person is doing really well here's what you know where they could maybe improve and then if you say okay now give me a uh you know a a development plan, and then you integrate that into petari right and you take you but i mean you get where i'm going, like if people understood um you know how do i get to be much more efficient.
00:19:52 Travis 
I mean, that was the first example off the top of your head. I'm already doing that today, right? After my meetings, I look at a transcript if I'm recording it, and we're pulling feature requests, we're pulling examples, and all of that goes into the right repository. And then my product guy has an agent that reviews that and says, is this something that's already in our product roadmap?
00:20:22 Travis 
Yes, no. Anything that isn't, right, goes onto the list, and then he can obviously manually review that. But the more times, you know, every time a new feature request sort of comes up, you know, he knows, oh, another customer's asked for that, it moves up the priority list. So there's so many things that you can automate, but it's not, this is the problem. This is what I was saying. the business executives high up are not the people who know what really needs to be done but they're the ones who are cutting the checks for all this ai stuff it's the people who are on the ground day to.
00:20:54 Travis 
day that that know what needs to happen and that know how to improve their life to improve the business so if we enable the people we can help fix the business does that make sense yeah i'll.
00:21:09 Speaker 3 
just let me try to rephrase that to see if i so what i'm envisioning what i'm understanding is essentially it's a system of agents actually where you have the travis agents the chris agent and then you have the acme agent that sits in the back and is connected to all these little agents so that one the chris agent teaches chris the chris maybe it's a hierarchical thing there is a team chris agent that tells you chris here's your team here are the things that, I don't know.
00:21:39 Travis 
So I'm not necessarily trying to build all of those different things. That's just an example. What I'm trying to do, and again, in the long run, yes, there's probably a lot of other things that we could try to build. But instead, you know, what I'm trying to do is I'm trying to identify. So, you know, having this conversation with you, like this is the conversation that the agent would have. It would say, hey, you just got off of a Zoom meeting. You know, I noticed that they talked about, you know, product feature challenge.
00:22:13 Travis 
You know, you know, you just sent a Slack message to your teammate. You know, would you like for us to work together to build these these agents? Right. So we're not trying to build all of those things. Instead, we're trying to enable the human. to brainstorm ideas and to know enough about vibe coding or you know lovable or whatever you know there's a million tools out there that can do very similar things so we're all.
00:22:44 Travis 
about enabling the human to better interact with AI and to brainstorm on all these use cases and that's what I'm saying I don't want to create an agent to solve every problem I want to enable the people to be creative so that they can solve real problems and develop something they actually need to make their life better.
00:23:06 Speaker 3 
No I mean with that I fundamentally agree because as you say you have all these tools and say hey Grave be creative be productive and people say Chachapiti was the nearest hotel and you're like okay that's just a Google search that's not AI okay.
00:23:26 Travis 
And that's where, you know, so like I said, my partner, well, so we built this framework. So I sort of classified people into zero through four, so I guess five levels of AI competency, you know, and he works with, you know, PhD students and people with doctorates and, I mean, scientists who are, you know, relatively technology forward. And he says, most of his class is level zero through one. And he's like, you know, even after a week with them, he gets them maybe to level two,
00:23:59 Travis 
right? You know, and it's like, okay, there's so much more that I think we could help people with. And, you know, and it's not just knowledge workers, right? You know, even if you're a mechanic, you know, if you're crawling around underneath a car, instead of, you know, getting up and going looking up, you know, a manual for, you know, Mercedes Benz Unimog to try to figure out, you know, where this wire goes and what it's connected to. If you just start to understand, you can talk to AI and say, hey, here's what I'm experiencing.
00:24:33 Travis 
Like, go look this up for me and help me troubleshoot, right? Everyone on earth is a potential client. right whether you're using ai to improve actually i'll give you a really good example so you know working you know with this breast cancer startup um uh we encourage people who just recently got diagnosed with breast cancer to chat with ai about how to share their diagnosis with their family, like that i mean that's that's a really difficult conversation because it's going to impact you know.
00:25:05 Travis 
your life people are scared they're going to have questions the best feedback we got was on that topic they were like i was amazed that an ai could give me good advice you know that it it understood a little bit about my situation and it gave me custom advice you know about how to talk to my daughter about it and how to talk to my husband and you know suggestions about how they can help me you know it's like most people wouldn't think of ai to do something like that you know they're using like exactly like you said or google replacement so.
00:25:35 Travis 
that's what i'm trying to build.
00:25:37 Speaker 3 
anyways. I know, it's interesting. I'm just thinking, but the USP would be that it's kind of agnostic to different products, because now Pitari does the same, right? Do a self-evaluation and then Pitari says, whatever, accountability, here's a podcast, how about business review, listen to it. Thanks.
00:25:59 Travis 
Yeah, right.
00:26:01 Speaker 3 
Okay.
00:26:03 Travis 
This is proactive. It's your co-pilot, your coach that's literally there every minute of every day that you're on your computer working, right? And Pitari doesn't look at what you do. Pitari takes the input you give it, processes it, and tries to give you a good guess or a good plan. Right. I, you know, fundamentally, and this is where some of the challenges are that we're trying to hash out, you know, but, you know, if I see every app that you open and, you know, the way that you write prompts, I mean, there's, you know, we have to be very careful with data privacy.
00:26:39 Travis 
And I think I have a plan for some of that or for most of it, actually. But, you know, we, you know, first, the first step is to earn people's trust because, you know, not everyone's going to want you to watch everything that they do. You know, one of the first guardrails we made a decision as a company on is, you know, are we willing to provide like unlimited visibility to companies about what their employees are doing? And the answer is no, you know, because we want people to feel secure and not like this.
00:27:16 Travis 
Right. So, you know, there's a lot of things to think about. But anyways, you're one of the smartest people that I worked with at Zscaler and, you know, knowing how everything's going there. But then again, it is a startup. I just wanted to see if.
00:27:34 Speaker 3 
you would have any interest. Well, the mission sounds great. I mean, there are lots of other things to consider, of course. But as mentioned, I think that's the right way forward. I had, a chat with a friend recently and I said, you know, what AI needs, it needs a trainer. Because sometimes it just has to tell me, Chris, do you really want me to ask me that? That's really something you should Google or figure out yourself in five seconds. In other words,
00:28:07 Speaker 3 
you're not using me right. And then what you're saying is exactly. And let's use AI to help me fix it.
00:28:18 Travis 
So, so I'll actually I can give you an example. I mean, literally, I'm just going to share my screen and what I'm working on right now. So, so, and I'll try to I'll try to sort of summarize this but so I, you know, I'm building agents within our company like folder structure, sort of. to where, you know, whenever somebody creates a new folder,
00:28:52 Travis 
so, you know, I just created like an accounting and finance folder to store expenses, okay. And so, you know, what I have is I'm running multiple agents, ChadGBT, Codex, Claude, Gemini, a bunch of other stuff. And so, I'm basically like going through as I'm building these things and saying, okay, you know, it creates this dot agents folder with the readme.
00:29:23 Travis 
The readme says, you know, here's the current state of the project that you're in. Like, what am I trying to accomplish? You know, who's the owner? What are problems that we, you know, we face during this working session? You know, when should this be reviewed? What else in the company does it relate to? And it does a comparison. So, anytime I ask, it to build something for me you know it goes back somewhere in here and it goes to our company spec that says you know here's our mission here's our guard rails here's our guiding principles.
00:29:59 Travis 
and it says is this new process that i'm building or this new legal document or this new, product management tool is this in line with my company's mission guiding principles and operating procedures so that you know every time somebody interacts with the agent the agent is taking into consideration all of those things with everything that it builds right and then there's another agent that that goes through and looks uh.
00:30:34 Travis 
it looks for consistency, there's another agent that goes through and looks for PII and security breaches, you know, and, you know, so one person is able to sort of build all of this stuff. And so now whenever anybody joins the company, you know, they don't necessarily have to know every process and every everything, they start chatting with the agent and the agent can say, you know, hey, it sounds like, you know, maybe you have a misunderstanding of what this process is, you know,
00:31:06 Travis 
new hires are supposed to go through this. And here's some of the key concepts that you need to know. Because everything is documented, and structured and so forth. So I'm able to hire good people on board and, you know, being productive, but creating leveraging AI to create guardrails, and to keep everyone aligned, right, because, you know, every decision, you know, every decision that gets created, written down, whatever, you know, is codified.
00:31:42 Travis 
And so, you know, again, eventually, you know, this all becomes transparent to the user. But yeah, so that's, and it's easy, it's honestly, it's relatively easy to build this stuff. But exactly like you said, you know, it's actually going back and forth with me, because I've written the prompt in such a way that I said, I don't want you to just tell me, yes, I want you to identify all the issues. I want you to be, you know, constructive,
00:32:15 Travis 
but challenge me, you know. But if you don't know that you can, you know, customize the way that you interact with AI, you know, then you're just going to be used to getting Google type responses. And that's what 99% of the population today are doing.
00:32:33 Speaker 3 
that's what we're trying to fix and that's nice i'm just trying to rephrase it all the time but essentially you know i mean it's a b2b idea at first i think so i mean so that's that's actually.
00:32:47 Travis 
one of the questions that i don't have a clear answer on you know i mean if i think about it like if i go and i sit down with a cfo you know and i or a ceo and i say okay you know i can show you your roi because you know if we run for the first weeks or month or something and we just watch people's existing processes you know i can say before they worked you know four hours a week building powerpoints and now they you know can do the same thing in 15 minutes that's a pretty fast roi statement so yes i mean i think that you know b2b is probably a good use case but.
00:33:23 Travis 
If I think about the SMB business, it's huge if you can get to it and if you don't have to invest sales people's time getting there. And if you think about every small business today, they want more time with their kids. They want to not get run out of business by big business. And so you may find actually an even faster ROI, shorter sales cycles with the SMB market.
00:33:56 Travis 
And honestly, you could even sell straight to consumers. So I don't know the answer. I think we're trying to figure that out right now. We'll test all of the above, I think, as soon as we're ready to launch. um but my guess is we'll have sales teams um and then you know they're mainly focused on enterprise, and then the smb and consumer market will do through massive marketing campaigns, so but conceivably almost everyone on earth is you know a potential consumer so.
00:34:30 Speaker 3 
but i mean sorry this crossover no if i'm just thinking about the german market i think the smb is actually the smartest way to go right because they have the sweet spot of, sometimes having a lot of revenue the sweden champions, but they can't find any personnel to do anything because they all go to siemens whatever.
00:34:53 Travis 
and then you tell them exactly. In Spain, that's the truth too. So, you know, it could be that, you know, we mainly focus on hiring the sales team in the US and, you know, and we mostly focus on S&B in Europe. And honestly, I think Europe in general is further behind on AI adoption anyways. You know, so, but yeah, I mean, you're spot on. Anyways, I just, I just wanted to run the idea by you and, you know, I would love any, you know, any feedback and questions and maybe.
00:35:28 Travis 
take the weekend to think about it. And if you want to chat again next week, I really value, you know, your input. You may come up with stuff that I hadn't even thought of. But, you know, and again, there's no rush, but if it's something you'd be interested in, even if it were sort of part time or something, you know, I'm trying to build out the team and see where it goes.
00:35:53 Speaker 3 
no i'll definitely think about it again uh as you see i already, started to allocate some cpu to it um yeah definitely let me think about it uh i'll send you my number because i think it's easier to just yeah chat via whatever, as a german of course i use signal or whatever i mean.
00:36:19 Travis 
so if i have telegram i don't think i should probably have signal but i don't message is.
00:36:28 Speaker 3 
also fine not just um just a huge fan of whatsapp but uh so uh or let's see yeah if you have iphone.
00:36:39 Travis 
uh then there you see the chat so if you have iphone you can just pop in my email and use imessage.
00:36:51 Speaker 3 
It's the chat. I never used Google.
00:36:53 Travis 
Yeah, it was weird for me, too. Bottom right, there's, like, a little bubble next to the person.
00:37:05 Speaker 3 
Who is this? Is this a number from the States. 
00:37:08 Travis 
Yeah, my main WhatsApp number is the one from the States. And then my email I've had for freaking ever. Actually, it's kind of a point of pride for me because, like, they got rid of the Mac.com domain, basically, and, you know, moved to iCloud for everything. And so, like, if you ever run across somebody who has, you know, a Mac.com domain email, it's, you know, hands down,
00:37:40 Travis 
they're an old-school Mac person.
00:37:45 Speaker 3 
Yeah, no, I mean, I just phoned you.
00:37:48 Travis 
Okay, yeah, I got it. I'll send you a number.
00:37:52 Speaker 3 
Perfect. No, cool. I mean, let's definitely stay in touch. I'll definitely think about it. Sure. Okay. Any specific feedback you'd like? I mean, just so that I can structure it already in terms of other use cases.
00:38:06 Travis 
Yeah, I mean, I guess the best feedback that I'm really, I guess, kind of asking for everyone, you know, is look at how you use AI today and, you know, and say, okay, you know, if I had something like this, what would I want it to do? You know, and it's hard like this. And this is part of what we're running into is, you know, a lot of people I talk to actually.
00:38:38 Travis 
So one of my first employees, lover to death. She's a lawyer by by trade. Right. You know, I'm bringing her on as chief of staff or whatever. And, you know, and she said the other day, she was like, you know, she's like, I, you know, yeah, I can make parts of my life better. And I mean, and she's working here, like she believes in our mission. But she's like, I was never going to sign, the medical release for my kids, you know, for their school. And I said, why won't it?
00:39:09 Travis 
And she's like, well, not in our lifetime it won't. And so I walked her through exactly how it could do that. And she and she had never even thought of, you know, that as a potential use case. And so it's like it's kind of the yeah, I mean, it's a transformation mindset sort of thing. And so asking people to think of the use, cases that you wish you had help with is really kind of hard because.
00:39:40 Travis 
you know, most people don't even know the right questions to ask when we get, started, and that's why a lot of what we're going to have to do early on is is, just start giving people good examples. And once once they see certain things, working, you know, I think your brain start to bring chemistry changes a little bit. Right. And that's honestly like one of my first use cases was my dad. Right. You're frozen. Let me hear you. Thank you for watching!
00:40:11 Travis 
oh okay there we go sorry my camera maybe close me yeah one of my first you know, examples was my dad you know my dad's like 75 years old thought ai was going to be the end of the world and you know within an hour or two of working with him he he was like travis you have completely changed the way i mean he's still working right but he's like you've completely changed the way i do business um you know like that's our goal is to to help people see so much.
00:40:45 Travis 
value you know that that they're like yeah i understand this now i know at least how to get started um you know and then it's a journey after that right so that's the journey.
00:40:57 Speaker 3 
I mean, I see, you know, B2C, I already see lawyers, like, who the fuck knows what they are talking about, or we want to buy a house, someone has to sign off on it, and I have to pay him 10,000 euros so that he reads me a text and says, yeah, you understood it. That's like the first.
00:41:13 Travis 
thing. I've already got a law firm, actually, so when I was consulting with a law firm about helping us to incorporate, he was like, can I sign up to work with you guys? Like, literally, almost everyone I've talked to are like, you know, where do I sign up? And I'm like, well, you know, we're still developing the product, but yes, you know, you can be a design partner. You're spot on. I mean, I built... So, you know, we're trying to, I'm trying to figure it out, finalize it right now, but we're going to, I think, incorporate in the Cayman Islands with a subsidiary in the US and in Europe. And so there's all like inner company, IP transfer paperwork, and there's all kinds of stuff. I built it all in a weekend. And I asked, you know, like, how much would a consulting firm or a law firm, an accountant firm, you know, charge me for all this?
00:42:09 Travis 
It came back and said somewhere between $70,000 and $100,000 to build all that paperwork. And I built it by myself in a weekend. Now, I'm going to have a lawyer review it, you know, but paying them for a couple of hours, you know, at $600 an hour to review something is not $100,000. So, you know, yes, you're spot on. Like, you know, once people start seeing how, you know, what they could do with this, it's amazing.
00:42:40 Travis 
I think there's a great business here.
00:42:42 Speaker 3 
Yeah, I mean, I will definitely have some other questions later on, like what kind of role would you have in mind, but I think that's step two. Yeah. Or three, whatever. No, cool. Let me think about it. I'll definitely come back to you on that.
00:43:01 Travis 
Awesome, man. Well, enjoy your weekend. And yeah, just just shoot me a message next week whenever you have some time to chat. This is my full time right now. So, you know, I have a lot on my plate, but most of it's flexible.
00:43:15 Speaker 3 
Nice. No, then I'll definitely do that. So thanks a lot for reaching out and thinking of me. It was super interesting talk.
00:43:25 Travis 
It was. I'm looking forward to your feedback later. Have a good one. Talk to you later. You too. Cheers.
00:43:58 Speaker 1 
Bye.
