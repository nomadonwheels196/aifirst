00:03:45 Travis 
Hey, hey, hold on, microphone would probably help. Can you hear me? Yeah, yes. How's it going, man? So I was just sending you a note. I realized that when I sent you the original note, I put an invite on my calendar, but I was like, oh, I don't know where to send it to. And then I just realized I didn't send you the meeting info. And then I realized I don't have your phone number. So I guess I need to get your number.
00:04:16 Speaker 3 
Let me just send it through, otherwise I'll forget.
00:04:20 Travis 
How are you. 
00:04:23 Speaker 3 
Busy, but good. How are you. 
00:04:25 Travis 
I'm doing awesome, man. Yeah, it's been, I don't know, it's been a crazy couple of months. Um, but you know, I mean, from a personal standpoint, um, everything's going good, you know, married life's fantastic. Um, uh, my, my step-mom has had some, some health issues lately, but I, you know, hopefully she'll pull through. Um, and yeah, I mean, and then trying to, to build a new company, um, which, you know, I, I had almost forgotten what it was like to get up every.
00:05:00 Travis 
morning and be like crazy excited about what you do. Um, you know, I mean, I don't be wrong. I, I loved, you know, I loved my time at Zscaler. I worked with amazing people. Um, you know, but, Zscaler today I think is different than Zscaler six years ago, whatever, whenever I started, you know, and I think it's probably different even than a couple of years ago, whenever a lot of people started, but. You know, it's been super exciting. And, you know, and well, so I guess probably last time I talked to you,
00:05:33 Travis 
you know, I had been working with a buddy on like a breast cancer startup, you know, and we we sort of reached a point where I said, look, you know, dude, I love this, I love the mission, I love what we're doing. But eventually I was kind of like, we're not exactly moving at the pace that I had envisioned us moving. You know, I mean, he's got a family and I don't know, it was all good, you know. But I was like, OK, I started having brainstorming ideas.
00:06:04 Travis 
I was like, you know, I think there's something else I actually want to go work on myself. And so, yeah, I don't know, a month or so ago, I started working on that. I found a partner. So building an AI business, right, like everyone else, I guess. But, you know, I found I found a guy, a friend of a friend who has been working like in actually working in the AI space for quite a while, like doing consulting and training and all kinds of.
00:06:35 Travis 
stuff, you know, and so he's already billing, I don't know, 250k a year, you know, just consulting and enablement. But it's just him, you know, so I mean, he doesn't really have any expenses. It's pretty good business. But, you know, he's like, Travis, I can't scale. He's like, I need a way to scale. And, you know, and well, I had already been thinking about, you know, I'll get into it, you know, in a minute or whatever, but I've already been thinking about certain very similar things. And so I said, dude, let's let's go see if we can build this,
00:07:06 Travis 
you know, see if it works and have some fun. And, you know, if not, like, you know, we can both go back and get day jobs one day. But wouldn't it be nice, you know, after four or five years, you know, to to be a couple of hundred million dollars richer? You know, I can't do that, you know, in 10 years from now. I don't think I'd feel comfortable doing that right. But right now, if it works great, if it doesn't, you know, it's no big deal. So I'm excited, you know, long, long answer. But, yeah, nice. Really good. How about you? Has a has a family, has everything else going. 
00:07:41 Speaker 3 
For me, it's good. I mean, I got a daughter a couple of months ago, four and a half months ago. Yeah. Well, it's two now. It's more than doubling. It feels like double the kids in terms of pure numbers. But.
00:07:55 Travis 
But are you, I mean, I don't have any kids, so I don't exactly know, but I mean, are you at that age where you're sleeping or not? Is it like, you know, somebody staying up all night to take care. 
00:08:11 Speaker 3 
No, the bigger one sleeps fairly well until six, hopefully, so that's fine. And the little one is still breastfeeding, so not my job.
00:08:23 Travis 
Mark messing it up, yeah.
00:08:26 Speaker 3 
Exactly, so that's easy. Zizka, as you said, is different. Most of the people that joined when I joined or when you joined, I mean, they're just not there anymore. Also, you probably heard about Yard. Yeah. Also, an interesting move with this. Let's be all, let's focus the power on the sales, because... if someone knows what to do then it's sales or so they say okay sure oh man yeah no i i was.
00:09:07 Travis 
i was talking to uh to nils the other day and uh uh you know he you know we we started just talking about ai and he was telling me about the ai day launch day or whatever they did you know a little while back he's like travis was like i have never seen such a big show in my life i was like i can't say i'm surprised but you know i mean given that that's like my every day right now you know it justifies everything that i'm working towards so.
00:09:37 Travis 
i was like okay thumbs up for that that's yeah i hate to say it but i mean that's what i like to hear because that's what i'm trying to build a business off of so interesting because everyone.
00:09:47 Speaker 3 
is trying to do something but nobody seems to know what to do exactly with this ai thing, you, I think the best thing I've heard so far within Zscaler at least is training using time log series as large language models so that you can factor in time and not just, you know, a point in time and then using those on log data to help SOCs identify issues backwards. But that's still not the thing where you say, that's it.
