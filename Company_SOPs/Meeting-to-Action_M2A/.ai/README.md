# Automation for M2A

## Purpose
Support non‑secret prompting, lightweight configs, and helper scripts to assist M2A.

## Boundaries
- No secrets, tokens, or large artifacts.
- Prefer deterministic, logged runs; keep humans in the loop for high‑risk.

## Operate
- Run from repo root; log outputs; store canonical JSON and links.
- Follow `AGENTS.md` and reference `Company_SOPs/_TEMPLATE` for structure.
