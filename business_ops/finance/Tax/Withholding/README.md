## Contributing
- For authors (human or AI) creating or updating this folder: keep this README.md concise and actionable.
- Use scripts/new_dir.sh to scaffold new areas when appropriate.
- Link changes to any relevant spec (top-level or local), not only business_spec/*. If a spec governs or informs this folder, reference it explicitly.
- Avoid duplicating content that exists in parent README.md; link instead.
