# Ai‑First – Structuring Intake Form (Founders)

Purpose: Capture the minimum facts to evaluate where/when/how to incorporate and structure the
company, weighing effort, expense, risk, and personal founder implications.

## 1) Founders & Tax Profile
- Founders (legal names, % holdings, roles):
- Citizenship(s):
- Current tax residency (country, city):
- Expected residency changes (next 24 months):
- Board travel constraints (e.g., ability to attend Cayman meetings in‑person):
- Personal tax priorities (rank 1–3): salary vs dividends, 83(b) timing, early exercise, QSBS, §962 election, K‑1 comfort, foreign disclosures:
- Existing trusts/foundations or estate plans (if any):
- Crypto/digital assets with potential structuring impact (if any):

## 2) Business Model & Revenue (12–24 months)
- Primary lines (SaaS, licenses, consulting, services):
- Pricing model(s) and target gross margins:
- Revenue by customer country (%): US __%, ES/EU __%, UK __%, RoW __%
- Top customer profiles (enterprise, SME, gov/public):
- Intercompany flows (targets): royalty rate __% of revenue; service mark‑ups cost+ __%

## 3) Team & Hiring Plan (12–24 months)
- Headcount by country (EE/contractor split): US __ / __; ES __ / __; Other __ / __
- Leadership locations (directors/C‑level):
- In‑country HR needs (benefits, payroll providers):

## 4) IP & Data
- Where IP is (and will be) developed:
- Any pre‑existing founder IP to assign/license:
- AI/data handling notes (PII, special categories, data residency):
- DPO contact (name/email):

## 5) Fundraising & Governance

How we’ll use this
- Build a scenario matrix comparing: (A) Cayman+Delaware+Spain (ESA executed), (B) Cayman+Delaware
(with ESA-lite + outsourced CIGA), (C) UAE FZ IP HoldCo + Delaware+Spain, (D) US‑centric structure
with back‑license. Each scored for setup/ongoing effort, expense, compliance/tax risk, and personal tax
impact (QSBS, 83(b), 409A, GILTI/Subpart F exposure).
- Deliver a decision tree with “if/then” triggers and a 0–3 / 3–12 / 12–24 month rollout plan.
