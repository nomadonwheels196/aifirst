# Legal Review – Ai‑First (Batch 5: Shareholders & Investment)
**Date**: ${TS}
**Scope**: Shareholders Agreement, Investor Side Letter (Voting Covenant)
**Jurisdictions**: Cayman corporate; Spain carve‑outs noted

## Executive Summary
SA is strong: drag‑along ≥75% with Class B consent; founders‑only shotgun; Class B voting ratio auto‑adjust (cap 100:1); tag‑along/ROFR cross‑refs. Side letter term set to 5 years with carve‑outs.

### Risk Dashboard
- High‑Risk: 1 • Medium‑Risk: 2 • Low‑Risk: 2 • Compliant: 4

## High‑Risk
- H1: Shotgun/buy‑sell abuse potential (procedural)
  - File: Governance/Shareholders Agreement.md §10
  - Fix: Add mandatory mediation step prior to shotgun trigger and clarify founders‑only scope (already limited; reinforce procedure).

## Medium‑Risk
- M1: Side letter vs. SA – ensure tag‑along/ROFR are reference‑only; SA governs mechanics.
- M2: Maintain founder super pro‑rata cap (10%) and waterfall as in Appendix.

## Low‑Risk / Compliant
- L1: Voting covenant term (5 yrs / early termination triggers) consistent.
- L2: Dual‑class persistence and Class B consent protections clear.

## Recommended Actions (Batch 5)
- Add mediation pre‑condition; ensure explicit cross‑refs to SA sections in side letter.
