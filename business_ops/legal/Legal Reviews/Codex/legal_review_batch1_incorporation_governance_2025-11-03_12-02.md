# Legal Review – Ai‑First (Batch 1: Incorporation & Governance)
**Date**: ${TS}
**Scope**: Cayman M&A, Delaware Inc/Bylaws, Spain Estatutos/Escritura
**Jurisdictions**: Cayman Islands, USA (Delaware), Spain/EU

## Executive Summary
Governance is founder‑protective (dual‑class A=1 vote; B=10 votes; ≥75% drag + Class B consent; founder seat with removal only for Cause). Spain bylaws include casting vote and Madrid jurisdiction. Key execution risk: Cayman ESA must be evidenced (CIGA in Cayman), and Spain notarial placeholders should be finalized before filing.

### Risk Dashboard
- High‑Risk: 1 • Medium‑Risk: 3 • Low‑Risk: 3 • Compliant: 5

## High‑Risk
### H1: Cayman ESA operationalization
- File: Intercompany Agreements/Intercompany Agreement.md §2.5 (framework referenced here for governance alignment)
- Problem: Policy present; execution artifacts (Cayman board cadence, minutes, spend/CIGA logs) not yet evidenced.
- Fix: Schedule ≥2 Cayman board meetings/year, minute CIGA decisions (IP strategy, licensing), track spend; prep ESA return.

## Medium‑Risk
- M1: Spain Estatutos placeholders [•] – Governance/Spain SL Bylaws (Estatutos).md:20,67,111
- M2: Spain Escritura placeholders [•] – Governance/Spain SL Incorporation Deed (Escritura).md:14,17,47
- M3: Cross‑ref consistency for definitions – Prefer SA “Definitions” as the source for Qualified IPO/CoC.

## Low‑Risk / Compliant
- L1: Founder seat and Class B protections aligned across SA/M&A/Bylaws.
- L2: Casting vote and deadlock mechanisms are present; confirm minutes template.
- L3: Madrid venue set where applicable.

## Recommended Actions (Batch 1)
- Evidence ESA (board minutes/CIGA logs/spend).
- Finalize Spain [•] placeholders with counsel pre‑notary.
- Ensure SA “Definitions” referenced in Founder Agreement/EIP for consistency.
