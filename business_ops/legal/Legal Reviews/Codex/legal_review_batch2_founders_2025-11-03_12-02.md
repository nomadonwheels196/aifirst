# Legal Review – Ai‑First (Batch 2: Founders)
**Date**: ${TS}
**Scope**: Founder Agreement(s), Founder Stock Purchase Agreement, Delaware Founder Agreement
**Jurisdictions**: Cayman, USA (Delaware), Spain/EU (cross‑refs)

## Executive Summary
Founder docs have strong reverse vesting and repurchase at nominal value; board seat and casting vote align with SA. Primary risk is alignment of acceleration/departure terms with SA definitions and procedures to avoid conflicts.

### Risk Dashboard
- High‑Risk: 1 • Medium‑Risk: 2 • Low‑Risk: 2 • Compliant: 3

## High‑Risk
### H1: Departure/Acceleration alignment risk
- Files: Governance/Founder Agreement.md §3.2–3.4; Governance/Shareholders Agreement.md
- Problem: Potential divergence in acceleration triggers/definitions; repurchase mechanics must not conflict with SA.
- Fix: Add explicit cross‑reference to SA Definitions; harmonize acceleration (e.g., CoC + good/bad leaver triggers).

## Medium‑Risk
- M1: Schedules/dates placeholders ([Date]) to finalize at execution.
- M2: Delaware version cross‑checks (definitions) to mirror SA.

## Low‑Risk / Compliant
- L1: “No non‑compete” stance retained (US addendum optional) consistent with project policy.
- L2: Reverse vesting/repurchase mechanics are consistent.

## Recommended Actions (Batch 2)
- Redline Founder Agreement to import SA Definitions and align acceleration.
- Fill execution details at signing.
