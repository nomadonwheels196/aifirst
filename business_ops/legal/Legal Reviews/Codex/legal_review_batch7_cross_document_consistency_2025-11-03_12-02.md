# Legal Review – Ai‑First (Batch 7: Cross‑Document Consistency)
**Date**: ${TS}
**Scope**: Definitions, acceleration, governance thresholds, dispute resolution, cross‑refs

## Executive Summary
Most cross‑refs are updated to the new folder layout. Remaining priorities are harmonizing definitions and acceleration across SA/Founder/EIP and ensuring side‑letter references do not expand SA rights.

### Findings
- Qualified IPO / Change of Control – centralize in SA “Definitions”; reference from Founder Agreement and EIP.
- Acceleration – align Founder Agreement §3.3 with SA and ESOP; avoid conflicting triggers.
- Side letter – ensure tag‑along/ROFR are reference‑only and explicitly subordinate to SA Sections 3–4.
- Governing Law/Arbitration – Cayman + LCIA across SA and intercompany; Spain labor carve‑out preserved.

## Recommended Actions (Batch 7)
- Insert explicit cross‑refs in Founder Agreement/EIP to SA Definitions; confirm side‑letter references.
