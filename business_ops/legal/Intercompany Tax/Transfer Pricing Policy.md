# Ai‑First Group – Global Transfer Pricing Policy (Draft)

**Date:** 2025-10-17

**Prepared by:** Travis Sheppard

**Status:** Draft for Legal & Tax Counsel Review

---

## 1. Purpose

This document establishes the **Transfer Pricing Policy** for the Ai‑First Group, ensuring that all intercompany transactions between Ai‑First Holdings Ltd. and its subsidiaries comply with the **OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines**, local regulations, and the arm’s-length principle.

---

## 2. Scope

This policy applies to all entities within the Ai‑First Group:

---

## 3. Guiding Principles

- **Arm’s-Length Standard:** All related-party transactions must be priced as if conducted between independent enterprises under comparable circumstances.

| Management Services | Portugal | Cayman | Cost Plus | 5% markup |
| Shared Costs (e.g., SaaS, Infrastructure) | All | Shared | Cost Allocation | Based on revenue share or headcount |

---

## 6. Pricing Methodologies

### 6.1 Transactional Net Margin Method (TNMM)

Applied for licensing and service agreements where direct comparables are limited.

Net margins benchmarked using databases such as **RoyaltyStat**, **Orbis**, or **Compustat**.

### 6.2 Cost Plus Method

Used for R&D, operational, and management service transactions.

Markup determined using industry benchmarks (5–10% range, adjusted annually).

### 6.3 Comparable Uncontrolled Price (CUP) Method

Applied if reliable third-party comparable agreements exist (e.g., SaaS license fees or external contracts).

### 6.4 Benchmarking Analysis and Interquartile Ranges

All markups and royalty rates are established based on arm's‑length benchmarking using the
following methodology. The ranges below are illustrative and must be validated and refreshed
by an external transfer pricing study at least annually.

| Transaction Type | Method | Database | Median Rate | Interquartile Range | Last Updated |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| R&D Services (Cost Plus) | TNMM | Orbis (SIC 7371) | 8.2% | 6.1%–11.4% | 2025‑Q4 |
| Implementation Services | TNMM | Orbis (SIC 7372) | 7.5% | 5.8%–10.2% | 2025‑Q4 |
| Management Services | TNMM | Compustat | 5.5% | 4.2%–7.8% | 2025‑Q4 |
| IP Licensing (Software) | CUT/RPM | RoyaltyStat | 12.0% | 8.5%–18.0% | 2025‑Q4 |

Policy: If actual results fall outside the interquartile range for a given transaction, a
year‑end true‑up shall be made to bring results to the median. Benchmarking sources and search
criteria (screens, comparables) shall be retained in the documentation file.

### 6.5 DEMPE Analysis (Development, Enhancement, Maintenance, Protection, Exploitation)

| DEMPE Function | Performing Entity | Contribution % | Compensation Method |
|---|---|---:|---|
| Development (R&D) | Ai‑First Inc. (USA) | 60% | Cost + 8% (within benchmarked range) |
| Enhancement | Ai‑First Spain, S.L. (EU) | 20% | Cost + 7% |
| Maintenance | Shared (USA/Spain) | 10% | Cost allocation |
| Protection (IP filing/brand) | Ai‑First Holdings Ltd. (Cayman) | 5% | Direct cost |
| Exploitation (licensing) | Ai‑First Holdings Ltd. (Cayman) | 5% | Residual profit after ALP |

This DEMPE allocation will be reviewed annually and updated to reflect actual value creation
and People Functions.

## 13. Country‑by‑Country Reporting (CbCR)

### 13.1 Applicability and Thresholds
This Policy adopts OECD BEPS Action 13 and local CbCR rules. If the Ai‑First Group’s consolidated
revenue equals or exceeds EUR €750 million in the preceding fiscal year (or local equivalent),
the Group will prepare and file a Country‑by‑Country Report (CbC Report) for the relevant fiscal
year.

### 13.2 Filing Entity and Notifications
- Filing entity: The ultimate parent entity shall file the CbC Report in its tax jurisdiction.
  If the ultimate parent is not required to file or if exchange mechanisms are unavailable, a
  surrogate parent entity will be appointed in a qualifying jurisdiction.  
- Local notifications: Each constituent entity will make required CbCR notifications to its tax
  authority by the statutory deadline (e.g., Spain: with annual CIT return; USA: via Form 8975
  if applicable), identifying the reporting entity and jurisdiction.

### 13.3 Content and Format
The CbC Report will follow the OECD XML schema and include, by jurisdiction: revenues (related
and unrelated), profit/loss before tax, income tax paid/accrued, stated capital, accumulated
earnings, number of employees, and tangible assets other than cash.

### 13.4 Timelines and Governance
- Deadline: 12 months after the last day of the reporting fiscal year.  
- Governance: Group CFO owns CbCR; External Tax Advisor prepares the report; Board Audit
  Committee approves before filing.

### 13.5 Recordkeeping and Consistency
- Maintain CbCR workpapers and source reconciliations for at least 10 years.  
- Ensure consistency between CbCR, Master File, Local Files, statutory accounts, and tax returns.
