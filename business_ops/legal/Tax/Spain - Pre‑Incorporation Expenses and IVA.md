# Spain — Pre‑Incorporation Expenses and IVA (Working Note)

Summary
- Short answer: Yes, you can generally deduct pre‑incorporation expenses and recover associated IVA later, provided they are necessary for the business, properly documented, and correctly assumed by the company at/after incorporation. Having a VAT number (NIF‑IVA) does not exempt you from IVA on Spanish domestic purchases; you deduct it via returns. For certain cross‑border SaaS/digital services, a valid VAT number can avoid being charged foreign VAT (reverse charge instead).

Scope
- Applies to Spain S.L./S.A. entities forming now and beginning activity later.
- For planning; not legal/tax advice. Confirm with a Spanish gestor/asesor fiscal.

Corporate Income Tax (IS) — Expense Deductibility
- Pre‑incorporation expenses that are necessary for the business and later assumed by the company are typically deductible when the company starts activity.
- Evidence: invoices, contracts, proof of payment, and a corporate action (incorporation deed or post‑incorporation resolution) assuming those expenses.
- Accounting: record as pre‑operating expenses and expense them per PGC criteria (capitalize if appropriate; amortize if fixed/intangible assets).

IVA (VAT) — Key Points
- Domestic suppliers in Spain will charge IVA regardless of you having a VAT number. Registration does not create a blanket exemption on domestic purchases; it creates the right/obligation to deduct/account for IVA.
- Input IVA on pre‑activity expenses is deductible once the entity is a taxable person and expenses are directly linked to future taxable activity.
  - Practical: include those invoices in your first Modelo 303 after registration; regularize capital goods if applicable (bienes de inversión).
- Invoicing details matter: to deduct IVA, invoices should be addressed to the taxable person (the company).
  - Best: obtain a provisional NIF for the company “en constitución” so invoices can be issued to the company name + provisional NIF.
  - If invoices are in a founder’s personal name, IVA is generally not recoverable by the company unless the supplier issues corrected invoices (facturas rectificativas) to the company.

EU/International SaaS and Digital Services
- If you provide a valid EU VAT number to EU vendors, they typically do not charge their local VAT; you apply reverse charge in Spain (self‑assess output IVA and simultaneously deduct input IVA, usually net‑neutral if fully deductible).
- Without a VAT number, vendors may treat you as a consumer and charge foreign VAT under OSS rules. Recovering that foreign VAT later is limited and typically requires you to be VAT‑registered and to use the EU refund (Modelo 360) for eligible periods; pre‑registration periods may be excluded.

Practical Steps (Now → Post‑Incorporation)
- Before incorporation (preferred):
  - Request a provisional NIF for the company en constitución (via notary + AEAT, Modelo 036) and use it for all invoices (company name, address, provisional NIF).
  - Where possible, add the provisional VAT number to EU SaaS accounts to avoid being charged foreign VAT (reverse charge instead). If not yet available, minimize purchases or arrange monthly billing that starts after NIF‑IVA issuance.
- If you must buy now without a company NIF:
  - Ask suppliers if they can invoice to “<Company Name>, S.L. (en constitución)” and update later with provisional NIF as soon as available.
  - If invoices were issued to a founder, request corrected invoices to the company once formed; otherwise IVA may be non‑deductible by the company.
- After incorporation and VAT registration:
  - File Modelo 036/037 (census), request ROI (VIES) if doing intra‑EU operations, and start Modelo 303 (quarterly/monthly) and Modelo 390 (annual) as required. File Modelo 349 for intra‑EU supplies/acquisitions if applicable.
  - Include pre‑activity invoices in the first Modelo 303 and keep a register of input VAT by date and supplier; apply investment goods regularization rules where applicable.
  - For any foreign VAT charged pre‑registration, evaluate eligibility for EU VAT refunds (Modelo 360) once registered; feasibility depends on dates and status.

Timing and Limits
- IVA deduction window: generally up to 4 years from the time the deduction could have been exercised, subject to compliance and documentation.
- Keep a clean audit trail linking each pre‑incorporation cost to the business purpose and the company’s assumption of the obligation.

Answers to Common Questions
- “Can we deduct expenses made before we were incorporated?”
  - Generally yes, if necessary for the business, properly documented, and formally assumed by the company. For IVA, invoices must be in the company’s name (preferably using a provisional NIF) to deduct the input tax once registered.
- “If we had a VAT number now, would they not charge IVA?”
  - For Spanish domestic suppliers: they will still charge IVA; you deduct it later. Having a VAT number doesn’t exempt domestic purchases.
  - For many EU SaaS vendors: providing a valid VAT number usually prevents them from charging their local VAT (reverse charge applies), which is typically cash‑flow neutral in Spain if you have full deduction rights.

Risks and Trade‑offs
- Not obtaining/using a provisional NIF can result in invoices addressed to founders, making IVA non‑recoverable by the company unless corrected.
- Paying foreign VAT without a VAT number may be costly and hard to recover later.
- Registering an autónomo first to get a VAT number can work but introduces social security and other compliance obligations; weigh carefully.

Checklist (Founder‑Friendly)
- Get provisional NIF for the S.L. en constitución and use it on all invoices.
- Ensure invoices have correct company name, address, NIF, description, and IVA.
- Add the (provisional) VAT number to EU SaaS accounts; prefer reverse charge.
- Keep all contracts, invoices, and payment proofs; log them in an expense register.
- After registration, include pre‑activity invoices in first Modelo 303; regularize as needed.
- Seek a gestor’s confirmation for unique cases (foreign VAT, asset capitalization, succession).
