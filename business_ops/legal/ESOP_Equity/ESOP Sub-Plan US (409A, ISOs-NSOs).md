# ESOP Sub‑Plan — United States (409A; ISOs/NSOs) — Draft

Created by: Travis Sheppard
Category: Equity & Compensation — US Sub‑Plan
Status: Draft for Legal Review

## 1. Purpose and Scope
This US Sub‑Plan supplements the Global ESOP of Ai‑First Holdings Ltd. (Cayman) and applies to participants subject to U.S. tax. In the event of conflict, this Sub‑Plan controls for U.S. tax compliance.

## 2. Award Types
- Incentive Stock Options (ISOs) and Non‑Qualified Stock Options (NSOs), as defined under the Internal Revenue Code.

## 3. Fair Market Value and 409A Compliance (MANDATORY)

### 3.1 FMV Safe Harbor Requirement

The Fair Market Value (FMV) of the Company's ordinary shares for purposes of any option grant to a US taxpayer shall be determined exclusively by reference to an independent 409A valuation obtained in accordance with Treasury Regulation §1.409A-1(b)(5)(iv)(B) (the "409A Valuation").

The 409A Valuation must be prepared by a qualified independent valuation firm with expertise in equity compensation valuation and must apply generally accepted valuation methodologies (income approach, market approach, and/or asset approach) appropriate for private company valuations.

### 3.2 Valuation Timing and Material Events

**(a) Annual Requirement**: The Company shall obtain a 409A Valuation at least once every twelve (12) months.

**(b) Material Event**: The Company shall obtain a new 409A Valuation within thirty (30) days following any Material Event. "Material Event" means:
- (i) Issuance of equity securities in a bona fide financing (including preferred stock, convertible notes, or SAFEs);
- (ii) Any merger, acquisition, or change of control transaction;
- (iii) Secondary sale of Company shares establishing a valuation materially different from the most recent 409A Valuation;
- (iv) Significant change in the Company's business, financial condition, or prospects (e.g., major customer win/loss, regulatory approval/denial, substantial revenue milestone);
- (v) Any other event that the Administrator determines in good faith is reasonably expected to materially affect FMV.

**(c) Staleness**: A 409A Valuation is stale and may not be relied upon if:
- (i) More than twelve (12) months have elapsed since the valuation date; or
- (ii) A Material Event has occurred and thirty (30) days have elapsed without obtaining a new valuation.

### 3.3 Grant Prohibition

The Administrator **shall not grant** any stock option to a US taxpayer:

**(a)** If no current (non-stale) 409A Valuation is in effect;

**(b)** With an exercise price below the FMV per share stated in the most recent 409A Valuation;

**(c)** Without documenting in the grant resolution or written consent:
- The 409A Valuation date and the FMV per share stated therein;
- The exercise price per share for the grant;
- Confirmation that the exercise price equals or exceeds 409A FMV;
- Confirmation that no Material Event has occurred since the 409A Valuation date requiring a new valuation.

If the Administrator determines in good faith that any grant or term is not compliant with Code §409A (including grant date FMV or a required valuation refresh), such grant or term shall be automatically **reformed to the extent necessary to comply with §409A** and the Company shall take all reasonable steps to **correct** the non‑compliance in a manner intended to **minimize adverse tax consequences** to the affected Participant(s) (including, where available, reliance on applicable IRS correction programs and guidance). Nothing in this Section limits the Plan’s strong presumption of §409A compliance or the Administrator’s authority to implement reasonable administrative procedures to maintain such compliance.

### 3.4 No Administrator Override

The Administrator has **no discretion** to:

**(a)** Grant options to US taxpayers below 409A FMV;

**(b)** Use any valuation method other than an independent 409A Valuation for determining FMV for grants to US taxpayers;

**(c)** Rely on a stale 409A Valuation; or

**(d)** Override or waive any requirement of this Section 3.

Any attempted override or waiver is void and of no effect. The Administrator's sole discretion is limited to (i) selecting the qualified independent valuation firm, and (ii) determining in good faith whether a Material Event has occurred requiring a new valuation.

### 3.5 Board Certification

Prior to any option grant to US taxpayers, the Administrator shall certify in writing (which may be in the form of Board minutes, written consent, or separate certification):

**(a)** The date and FMV per share of the most recent 409A Valuation;

**(b)** That no Material Event has occurred since the 409A Valuation date that would require a new valuation, or if a Material Event has occurred, that a new 409A Valuation has been obtained within the required timeframe;

**(c)** That the exercise price for each grant equals or exceeds 409A FMV;

**(d)** That the grant complies with all requirements of this Section 3.

The certification shall be attached to or incorporated in the grant resolution and maintained in the Company's records.

### 3.6 Engagement and Reporting

**(a) Valuation Firm Engagement**: The Board shall engage a qualified independent valuation firm with demonstrated expertise in IRC §409A valuations for private companies. The engagement letter shall specify the scope of work, applicable valuation standards (including IRS Revenue Procedure 2022-20 or successor guidance), and delivery timeline.

**(b) Administrator Support**: The Board shall provide the Administrator with:
- A current 409A Valuation report promptly upon receipt;
- An annual compliance calendar specifying the 409A Valuation expiration date and renewal timeline;
- Prompt notice of any Material Event that may require a new valuation.

**(c) Quarterly Reporting**: The Administrator shall report to the Board at least quarterly on:
- All option grants made since the last report, including grant dates, number of shares, exercise prices, and recipients;
- Confirmation of 409A FMV compliance for each grant;
- Status of the current 409A Valuation (date, FMV, expiration);
- Any Material Events identified since the last report;
- Any compliance issues or concerns.

**(d) Material Event Tracking**: The Company shall maintain a log of all potential Material Events and the Administrator's good-faith determination of whether each event requires a new 409A Valuation, with documented rationale.

### 3.7 Deferrals and 409A Compliance

No deferral features will be included in any option grant that would violate IRC §409A, including:
- Deferral elections;
- Provisions allowing exercise price to be paid other than in full at exercise;
- Post-termination exercise periods exceeding the limits specified in Section 5;
- Reload provisions or similar features creating additional deferred compensation.

All option grants shall comply with the "stock rights" exemption under Treasury Regulation §1.409A-1(b)(5) or another applicable exemption from §409A coverage.

## 4. ISO/NSO Mechanics
- ISO eligibility limited to employees; annual ISO limit per Code §422(d) applies.
- Options intended as ISOs that exceed limits or otherwise fail ISO requirements will be
  treated as NSOs to the extent of such failure.

### 4.1 IRC §422(d) $100,000 Limit; Ordering; Reclassification
- Limit: To the extent that the aggregate Fair Market Value (determined at the grant date)
  of shares with respect to which ISOs become first exercisable by a Participant during any
  calendar year exceeds USD $100,000, such excess shall be treated as NSOs in accordance
  with Code §422(d).
- Ordering Rule: For purposes of applying the $100,000 limit, ISOs shall be deemed to become
  exercisable in the order in which they were granted. If multiple ISO grants are made on
  the same date, the Administrator may determine the order of exercisability for this
  purpose.
- Grant Agreement Split: Each Grant Agreement will specify, where applicable, the number of
  shares intended to qualify as ISOs and the number of shares designated as NSOs as a result
  of applying the $100,000 limit.
- Tracking: The Administrator shall maintain a schedule tracking, for each Participant, the
  portion of ISO awards that first become exercisable in each calendar year based on the
  vesting/exercisability schedule and the FMV at grant, and shall adjust classification as
  necessary to comply with Code §422(d).
- Post‑Termination: ISOs exercised more than ninety (90) days after termination of
  employment (other than due to death or disability) will be treated as NSOs to the extent
  required by Code.

### 4.2 Early Exercise Authorization (ISOs/NSOs)
- Authorization: Subject to the terms of the applicable Grant Agreement, options (including
  ISOs) may be exercised **prior to vesting** (an "Early Exercise"). Shares acquired upon
  Early Exercise shall remain **unvested restricted shares** and shall be subject to the same
  vesting schedule that applied to the option as if no Early Exercise had occurred.
- Company Repurchase Right: As a condition to Early Exercise, the Company shall have an
  irrevocable right to repurchase any unvested shares upon the Participant’s termination of
  service for any reason at a price per share equal to the original **exercise price** paid by
  the Participant. Such repurchase right shall lapse as the shares vest.
- Escrow/Legends: The Company may require that (i) unvested shares be held in escrow (with a
  stock power) until vesting or repurchase rights lapse, and/or (ii) appropriate transfer
  restrictions/legends be placed on the shares to reflect repurchase and other restrictions.
- **83(b) Election Notice and Form Delivery (Mandatory)**:
  - **(i) Administrator Obligation**: Within **five (5) Business Days** after a Participant exercises an option prior to vesting (Early Exercise), the Administrator (or Company designee) **shall deliver** to the Participant:
    - (a) A written notice explaining the availability and requirements of an election under IRC §83(b);
    - (b) A completed draft of IRS Form 8655 (Election Under Section 83(b) of the Internal Revenue Code) with the Participant's name, address, and the relevant stock information pre-filled;
    - (c) Instructions for timely filing the 83(b) election with the IRS (within **thirty (30) days** of the Early Exercise) and for providing a copy to the Company.
  - **(ii) Participant Responsibility**: Notwithstanding the Administrator's delivery obligation, the Participant is solely responsible for:
    - (a) Reviewing the 83(b) election form with the Participant's own tax advisors;
    - (b) Timely filing the 83(b) election with the IRS within thirty (30) days of the Early Exercise date;
    - (c) Providing a copy of the filed election to the Company within five (5) Business Days after filing with the IRS.
  - **(iii) Consequences of Failure to File**: The Administrator and Company make no representations or warranties regarding the tax treatment of restricted shares or the advisability of filing an 83(b) election. Failure to timely file an 83(b) election may result in the Participant recognizing ordinary income upon vesting (as the shares vest) rather than at exercise, and may result in a higher tax liability. The Participant acknowledges that the Company has no liability for the Participant's failure to file an 83(b) election or for any adverse tax consequences.
  - **(iv) Administrator Good Faith Compliance**: The Administrator's obligation is to use good faith efforts to deliver the notice and form within the specified timeframe. Any delay or failure to deliver shall not create liability for the Company, but the Administrator shall document delivery attempts in the Participant's equity file.
- ISO Holding Periods: For ISOs exercised early, holding period requirements under Code
  §422(a) are measured from the **exercise date**; any disqualifying disposition consequences
  apply per the Code.
- 409A: Options will not be granted with an exercise price below FMV. This Early Exercise
  feature is intended to avoid creating deferred compensation under §409A; to the extent any
  feature were deemed non‑compliant, the option shall be interpreted to the minimum extent
  necessary to preserve §409A compliance.

## 5. Termination and Post‑Termination Exercise
- Standard: 90‑day post‑termination exercise window; ISOs exercised after 90 days convert to NSOs.
- Cause: Immediate forfeiture upon termination for Cause.

## 6. Withholding and Reporting
Participants agree to satisfy all tax withholding obligations. The Company will issue appropriate tax forms (e.g., Form W‑2/1099).

## 7. Governing Law
This Sub‑Plan is interpreted to comply with U.S. federal tax law and applicable state law, and is administered by the Global ESOP Administrator.

## Definitions
- Business Day: any day other than Saturday, Sunday, or public holiday when banks are open for business in the Company’s principal place of business.
- 409A FMV: a fair market value determined by an independent valuation qualifying for §409A safe harbor.
