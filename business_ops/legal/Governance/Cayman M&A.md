Authorized Share Capital: 10,000,000 shares

Classes of Shares:

- Class A Ordinary Shares: One (1) vote per share.

- Class B Ordinary Shares: Ten (10) votes per share, subject to the Voting Ratio Adjustment
  set out below.

Rights and Preferences:

- Class A and Class B shares shall rank pari passu with respect to
dividends and distributions.

- Conversion: Class B shares may be converted into Class A shares at the
option of the holder. Class A may not convert into Class B.

- Voting Together: Except where a separate class vote is expressly required by law or these Articles, Class A and Class B shall vote together as a single class on all matters submitted to a vote of members, with voting power calculated in accordance with the rights of each class.

- Voting Ratio Adjustment (Class B): If, following any issuance of shares or other equity
  securities (or securities convertible into or exercisable for shares), the aggregate voting
  power of all outstanding Class B shares would represent less than fifty‑one percent (51%) of
  the total voting power of all outstanding shares (calculated on a fully diluted, votes‑cast
  basis), then the votes per share attributable to Class B shall automatically adjust upward to
  the minimum ratio necessary to maintain Class B voting power at fifty‑one percent (51%),
  rounded to the nearest whole number; provided that in no event shall Class B votes per share
  exceed one hundred (100). Within five (5) Business Days after any such issuance, the Company
  shall calculate and certify the adjusted Class B voting ratio and update the register of
  members accordingly.

- Protective Provisions: The following actions require the approval of holders of a majority of the outstanding Class B shares, voting as a separate class: (i) any amendment to the Memorandum or these Articles (including any change to the rights of Class A or Class B); (ii) creation or issuance of any new class or series of shares or any securities convertible into or exercisable for shares; (iii) any merger, consolidation, sale of substantially all assets, dissolution, or similar extraordinary transaction; (iv) removal or appointment of the Chair of the Board or the Chief Executive Officer; (v) approval of an annual budget that exceeds a previously approved budget by more than fifteen (15)% or any capital expenditure above USD/EUR 250,000 not in an approved budget; and (vi) transfer, exclusive license (other than non‑exclusive in the ordinary course), or encumbrance of core intellectual property.

## Board Meetings and Casting Vote

- Quorum: A majority of Directors then in office constitutes a quorum.
- Voting: Questions are decided by a majority of votes of Directors present.
- Chair’s Casting Vote: In the event of an equality of votes, the Chair shall have a second or casting vote. The casting vote shall not be exercised where the Chair has a disqualifying conflict of interest.

## Members’ Meetings (Optional Casting Vote)

- Unless otherwise required by law, an equality of votes at a general meeting may be resolved by a casting vote of the Chair of the meeting.

## **Transfer of Shares**

## Founder Director Protections and Removal

- Founder Director: The Board shall include at least one Founder‑appointed Director (the "Founder Director").
- Removal Only for Cause: The Founder Director may be removed only for "Cause" by (i) an affirmative vote of at least two‑thirds (2/3) of the Directors then in office and (ii) the affirmative vote of holders of a majority of the outstanding Class B shares, voting as a separate class. For these purposes, "Cause" means: (a) conviction of a felony involving moral turpitude; (b) fraud or willful misconduct that results in material harm to the Company; or (c) material breach of fiduciary duty or these Articles that remains uncured for thirty (30) days after written notice.

### Founder Seat Permanence Until Qualified IPO
- The Founder‑appointed Director seat shall be maintained and may not be eliminated, reclassified, or reduced prior to a Qualified IPO, except with the separate consent of holders of a majority of Class B shares and subject to Removal Only for Cause as set out above.
- Any action to reconstitute the Board that would remove the Founder‑appointed seat prior to a Qualified IPO shall be a Reserved Matter requiring Class B consent.

## Reserved Matters; Quorum and Class B Consent

- Quorum for Reserved Matters: For any Board vote on a Reserved Matter, quorum requires the presence (in person or by electronic means) of the Founder Director.
- Class B Protective Provisions: In addition to any other approvals required by law, the following actions (the "Reserved Matters") require the prior written consent of holders of a majority of the outstanding Class B shares, voting as a separate class: (a) any merger, consolidation, sale of substantially all assets, dissolution, or similar extraordinary transaction; (b) creation or issuance of any class or series of shares or any securities (including debt) convertible into or exercisable for equity, or any amendment to the rights of Class A or Class B; (c) removal or appointment of the Chair of the Board or the Chief Executive Officer; (d) approval of an annual budget exceeding by more than fifteen (15)% any previously approved budget or any capital expenditure above USD/EUR 250,000 not in an approved budget; (e) transfer, exclusive license (other than non‑exclusive in the ordinary course), or encumbrance of core intellectual property; and (f) any amendment to the Memorandum or these Articles or other governing documents that would adversely affect Class B rights.

### Repurchase of Unvested Founder Shares

The Company may, upon termination of a Founder’s service, repurchase any unvested shares at the original issue price (nominal value) as provided in the Founder Agreement. Such repurchase shall not require shareholder approval and shall be treated as an authorized reduction in share capital, and no FMV determination shall be required for such unvested repurchases.

### Buy–Sell Transfers Under Shareholders Agreement

Transfers of shares effected pursuant to a bona fide buy–sell mechanism or fair market value exit set out in any shareholders or voting agreement approved by the Board shall be deemed permitted transfers and shall not be subject to any right of first refusal or co‑sale contained in these Articles, provided that applicable law and notice formalities (if any) are satisfied.

## Shareholders Agreement Alignment

- Acknowledgment: The Company acknowledges the existence of one or more shareholders and/or founders agreements (each, a "Shareholders Agreement").
- Alignment: To the fullest extent permitted by Cayman law, the Company and its Directors shall take all reasonably necessary actions to give effect to the founder‑protective provisions of any Shareholders Agreement, including Reserved Matters, Class B separate consent, quorum safeguards, and the Chair’s casting vote, as reflected in these Articles.
- Consistency: If any inconsistency is identified between these Articles and a Shareholders Agreement regarding the scope of Reserved Matters or the approvals required, the Members and the Board shall, as soon as reasonably practicable, propose and vote upon amendments to these Articles to align with the protections set out in the Shareholders Agreement, without diminishing Class B rights provided herein.

## Definitions
 
## Dual‑Class Continuation Through Listing

- No Sunset: The rights of Class B (ten (10) votes per share) shall continue through any Qualified IPO and thereafter; there is no time‑based sunset or automatic conversion of Class B into Class A.
- Optional Conversion Only: Class B may convert into Class A at the option of the holder; Class A may not convert into Class B.
- Amendments: Any amendment, reclassification, or conversion affecting the foregoing requires the separate consent of holders of a majority of the outstanding Class B shares as set out in these Articles.

**“Vesting Commencement Date”** means the date of the Founder’s commencement of full-time service with the Company.

**“Cliff”** means the initial period during which no shares vest, after which a specified portion vests immediately.

**“Reverse Vesting”** means the mechanism by which the Founder holds legal title to all issued shares but the Company retains the right to repurchase unvested shares upon termination.

**“Series A”** means the first institutional priced equity financing of the Company led by one or more bona fide institutional investors and resulting in aggregate gross cash proceeds to the Company of not less than USD 10,000,000 (or EUR equivalent at the ECB reference rate on the signing date), pursuant to definitive financing documents approved by the Board.

**“Qualified IPO”** means a firm‑commitment underwritten public offering of the Company’s equity securities pursuant to an effective registration statement under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933 (or equivalent non‑U.S. law) resulting in aggregate gross proceeds to the Company of not less than USD 75,000,000 (or EUR equivalent at the ECB reference rate on the pricing date) and listing on the NYSE, Nasdaq, or another recognized national securities exchange.

## Dividends Policy

- No Dividends Pre‑Series A: No dividends shall be declared or paid prior to completion of a bona fide Series A equity financing of the Company (the "Series A").

## Liquidity Events; Board Approval

- Definition: "Liquidity Event" means any merger, consolidation, sale of substantially all assets, share sale resulting in a change of control, or dissolution.
- Board Approval: Any Liquidity Event must be approved by the Board of Directors in accordance with these Articles; for the avoidance of doubt, such actions also constitute Reserved Matters requiring Class B separate consent as set out above.

## Intellectual Property Ownership and Licensing

- Ownership: All intellectual property created in connection with the Group’s business shall be owned by the Company (Ai‑First Holdings Ltd., Cayman) and held centrally.
- Licensing to Operating Entities: The Company may grant licenses to its operating subsidiaries and affiliates, including U.S. and EU entities, under arm’s‑length intercompany agreements consistent with applicable transfer pricing rules.
- Transfers Outside Group: Any transfer, exclusive license (other than non‑exclusive in the ordinary course), or encumbrance of core IP outside the Group is a Reserved Matter requiring Class B separate consent.
