**Tax Residency and Economic Substance (Cayman Islands Economic Substance Act)**

All strategic decisions of the Company shall be made by the Board of Directors acting in the Cayman Islands or, where directors participate by electronic means, with a quorum including at least one director physically present in the Cayman Islands.

**Board Composition for Substance**: The Board shall at all times include at least one director who is resident in the Cayman Islands and who shall participate in Board meetings either in person in the Cayman Islands or by electronic means from the Cayman Islands.

**Economic Substance Compliance Requirements**:

**(a) Relevant Activity Classification**: The Board shall, within sixty (60) days of incorporation and annually thereafter, determine and document in Board minutes whether the Company is engaged in a "relevant activity" under the Cayman Islands Economic Substance Act (as revised) and International Tax Co-operation (Economic Substance) Act 2024, including:
- (i) Holding company business (holding equity participations in operating subsidiaries);
- (ii) Intellectual property business (holding and licensing intellectual property);
- (iii) Any other relevant activity as defined by the Economic Substance Act.

The Board shall document the basis for its classification and shall engage qualified Cayman advisors to confirm the classification.

**(b) Substance Requirements for Relevant Activities**: If the Company is engaged in a relevant activity, the Board shall ensure compliance with the Economic Substance Act by maintaining:

- **(i) Directed and Managed in Cayman**: The Company shall be directed and managed in the Cayman Islands. The Board shall hold meetings in the Cayman Islands (minimum two (2) per year with physical or electronic participation from Cayman), and all strategic decisions (including decisions on investments, acquisitions, dispositions, financing, intellectual property strategy, and material contracts) shall be made by directors acting in the Cayman Islands. Board minutes shall document that strategic decisions were made in the Cayman Islands.

- **(ii) Adequate Physical Presence**: The Company shall maintain premises in the Cayman Islands beyond the registered office. Adequate premises may include:
  - Office space leased or owned by the Company in the Cayman Islands;
  - Virtual office with physical access rights and meeting facilities in the Cayman Islands; or
  - Shared office facilities provided by the Company's professional director service provider or registered agent in the Cayman Islands.

- **(iii) Adequate Employees and Personnel**: The Company shall engage employees or qualified service providers in the Cayman Islands with skills appropriate to the relevant activity. Adequate personnel may include:
  - Employees directly employed by the Company and resident in the Cayman Islands;
  - Professional director services provided by a Cayman-licensed corporate services provider; or
  - Outsourced service providers in the Cayman Islands contracted to perform substance functions (e.g., qualified Cayman-resident directors making strategic decisions, administrative personnel, compliance officers).

The number and qualifications of employees/personnel shall be proportional to the nature and scale of the relevant activity.

- **(iv) Adequate Operating Expenditure**: The Company shall incur operating expenses in the Cayman Islands proportional to the level of relevant activity, including:
  - Director fees for Cayman-resident directors;
  - Registered office and registered agent fees;
  - Office lease or virtual office fees;
  - Employee salaries or professional service provider fees;
  - Administrative expenses (legal, accounting, compliance);
  - Travel expenses for Board meetings in Cayman.

- **(v) Core Income-Generating Activities (CIGA) in Cayman**: For any relevant activity, the Company shall conduct the core income-generating activities (CIGA) for such activity in the Cayman Islands. CIGA requirements vary by relevant activity:
  - **Holding Company Business**: Holding and managing equity participations (strategic decisions on acquisitions, dispositions, governance of subsidiaries).
  - **Intellectual Property Business**: Strategic management and protection of IP, development and exploitation of IP assets, licensing negotiations, monitoring and enforcement of IP rights.

The Board shall document in minutes that CIGA are being performed in the Cayman Islands by Cayman-resident directors and/or qualified Cayman service providers.

**(c) Pure Equity Holding Company (Reduced Substance Standard)**: If the Company qualifies as a **pure equity holding company** under the Economic Substance Act (holding only equity participations in operating subsidiaries with no other relevant activity such as intellectual property business, financing, or leasing), the Company may comply with the reduced substance standard by:

- (i) Filing annual economic substance notifications with the Cayman Islands Tax Information Authority within the prescribed deadlines (within twelve (12) months after fiscal year-end);

- (iii) Maintaining adequate employees (or outsourced service providers) and premises in the Cayman Islands for holding and managing equity participations;
- (iv) Documenting in Board minutes that the Company conducts no relevant activities other than holding equity and qualifies for the reduced substance standard.

**Important**: If the Company holds and licenses intellectual property (even to Group subsidiaries), the Company is engaged in **intellectual property business** (a relevant activity) and the **full substance test** under subsection (b) above applies, not the reduced standard.

**(d) Quarterly Substance Review**: The Board shall review economic substance compliance at least quarterly and shall include in Board minutes:
- Confirmation that the Company maintains adequate substance (premises, employees/personnel, expenditure, CIGA);
- Summary of Board meetings held in Cayman or with Cayman-resident director participation during the quarter;

- Any changes in the Company's activities that may affect relevant activity classification or substance requirements;

- Review and certify the Company's economic substance compliance;
- Confirm the Company's relevant activity classification;
- Provide recommendations for maintaining or enhancing substance;
- Prepare or review the Company's annual economic substance notification to the Tax Information Authority.

The Board shall receive and review the advisor's written certification and recommendations and shall document receipt and any actions taken in Board minutes.

- Economic substance report (if requested by the Tax Information Authority);
- Any other filings or information requests from CIMA or the Tax Information Authority.

The Company Secretary or registered agent shall be responsible for timely filing, and the Board shall confirm in minutes that all required filings have been made.

**(g) Consequences of Non-Compliance**: The Board acknowledges that failure to satisfy the economic substance test may result in:
- Penalties of up to CI$100,000 (approximately USD $122,000) per year for failure to satisfy the economic substance test;
- Automatic exchange of information with foreign tax authorities (including the United States Internal Revenue Service and the Spanish Agencia Tributaria);
- Potential involuntary strike-off and dissolution of the Company for persistent non-compliance;
- Assertions by the United States Internal Revenue Service that the Company is a Controlled Foreign Corporation (CFC) with insufficient substance, resulting in GILTI (Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income) inclusions or PFIC (Passive Foreign Investment Company) treatment for U.S. shareholders;
- Risk of the Cayman Islands being listed on the EU non-cooperative jurisdictions list or OECD/FATF watchlists, affecting the Company's ability to transact with EU counterparties.

## 4. Shareholders’ Agreement (Draft)

### 4.1 Parties

- Founders (Class B Shareholders)
- Investors (Class A Shareholders)
- Ai‑First Holdings Ltd. (“Company”)

### 4.2 Purpose

To govern the relationship among shareholders, protect minority investors, and preserve founder control.

### 4.3 Board Composition

- Initially 3 Directors: 2 appointed by Class B holders (founders), 1 by Class A holders (investors).
- Increases to 5 upon Series A, with 3 Class B (founders), 2 Class A (investors).

### 4.4 Founder Vesting

**Vesting Schedule**: 4-year monthly vesting with 1-year cliff, commencing on the date shares are issued to each founder.

**Single-Trigger Acceleration** (change of control only): If a Change of Control (as defined below) occurs and within 12 months following such Change of Control the founder's role and responsibilities are materially diminished, or the founder is terminated without Cause (as defined below) or experiences a Constructive Termination (as defined below), then 50% of the founder's unvested shares shall accelerate and immediately vest.

**Double-Trigger Acceleration** (change of control + termination): If within 12 months following a Change of Control, a founder is terminated without Cause or experiences a Constructive Termination, then 100% of such founder's unvested shares shall accelerate and immediately vest; provided, however, that such acceleration shall be delayed to the extent necessary to comply with applicable tax law (including but not limited to IRC §409A) or to avoid immediate taxation absent liquidity, as determined by the Board in consultation with qualified tax counsel.

**Definition of Change of Control**: A "Change of Control" means: (i) any merger, consolidation, or reorganization in which the Company is not the surviving entity or in which holders of the Company's voting shares immediately prior to such transaction hold less than 50% of the voting power of the surviving entity immediately after such transaction; (ii) a sale, lease, exclusive license, or other disposition of all or substantially all of the Company's assets; (iii) any transaction or series of related transactions in which any person or group becomes the beneficial owner of more than 50% of the Company's voting power; or (iv) a Qualified IPO (as defined in the Articles).

**Definition of Cause**: "Cause" shall mean: (i) conviction of, or plea of guilty or no contest to, a felony or any crime involving fraud, dishonesty, or moral turpitude; (ii) willful misconduct or gross negligence causing material harm to the Company or its reputation; (iii) material breach of fiduciary duty as a director or officer, as finally adjudicated by a court of competent jurisdiction; or (iv) material breach of any employment agreement, service agreement, or the Shareholders Agreement that remains uncured for 30 days following written notice from the Company specifying the breach.

**Definition of Constructive Termination**: "Constructive Termination" means, without the founder's express written consent: (i) a material reduction (greater than 20%) in the founder's base compensation; (ii) a material reduction in the founder's authority, duties, or responsibilities from those in effect immediately prior to the Change of Control; (iii) a relocation of the founder's principal work location by more than 50 miles from the location immediately prior to the Change of Control; or (iv) any material breach by the Company of the founder's employment or service agreement; provided in each case that the founder provides the Company with written notice of the condition giving rise to Constructive Termination within 90 days of its occurrence and the Company fails to remedy such condition within 30 days of receiving such notice.

**Tax Mitigation**: In the event that acceleration of vesting would trigger immediate taxation under applicable law (including but not limited to IRC §83, §409A, or §1291-1298 (PFIC rules)) without providing the founder with sufficient liquidity to satisfy such tax obligation, the parties agree to work in good faith to restructure the acceleration to defer taxation to the extent permitted by applicable law, including through extended exercise periods, same-day sale arrangements, net settlement, or other mechanisms recommended by qualified tax counsel.

**PFIC Analysis Required**: Prior to issuance of founder shares, the Company shall engage qualified US international tax counsel to analyze whether the Company is or may be classified as a Passive Foreign Investment Company (PFIC) under IRC §1291-1298, and if so, to advise on protective elections (including IRC §1295 QEF election or §1296 mark-to-market election) or restructuring alternatives to minimize adverse tax consequences for founders who are US citizens or tax residents.

### 4.5 Information Rights

Investors holding at least 5% may request quarterly financials and annual audited statements.

### 4.6 Pre-Emptive Rights

Investors have the right to participate pro rata in future equity offerings.

### 4.7 Drag-Along and Tag-Along

  (75%) of the voting power approve (votes-cast basis) and (ii) a majority of the outstanding
  Class B shares approve, voting as a separate class, consistent with the Shareholders
  Agreement.
- Tag-Along: Minority holders may participate in sale under same terms.
