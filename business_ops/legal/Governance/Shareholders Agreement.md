## 1. Vesting of Founder Shares

### **Founder Reverse Vesting**

All Founder Shares are subject to a reverse vesting arrangement pursuant to each Founder's Founder Agreement. No transfer, sale, or encumbrance of unvested shares shall be valid unless the Company's repurchase right has expired or been waived in writing by the Board of Directors.

The Company shall have the right to repurchase any unvested shares in accordance with the vesting schedule and repurchase terms contained in the applicable Founder Agreement.

- Each Founder agrees that their Shares shall be subject to a four (4) year vesting schedule with a one (1) year cliff, with twenty-five percent (25%) vesting on the first anniversary of the Vesting Commencement Date and the remaining seventy-five percent (75%) vesting in equal monthly installments over the subsequent thirty-six (36) months.

- Unvested Shares shall be subject to repurchase by the Company at the **original issue price** in the event of termination of service for any reason.

### **Repurchase Price Definition**

For the avoidance of doubt, the repurchase price for any unvested Founder Shares shall equal the **original issue price** paid by the Founder, which shall be the par value or nominal value ($0.0001 per share for Class A and Class B Ordinary Shares) unless the Founder paid a higher price at issuance. The repurchase price shall **not** be adjusted for fair market value appreciation, subsequent financing rounds, or any independent valuation of the Company. Any founder acquisitions of shares in secondary transactions (i.e., other than original issuance) are not subject to reverse vesting or Company repurchase under this Section unless expressly agreed in writing by the Company and such Founder.

### Founder Restrictive Covenants (Clarification)
This Agreement does not impose any post‑termination non‑compete on Founders. Founders remain bound by confidentiality obligations and any non‑solicitation covenants as set forth in their Founder Agreements and, where applicable, employment agreements, subject to mandatory local law.

### **Repurchase Mechanics (Unvested Founder Shares)**

**Notice**: Within ten (10) Business Days after a Founder's termination of service, the Company may deliver written notice to the Founder (or the Founder's legal representative or estate) of its election to exercise the repurchase right (the "Repurchase Notice"). The Repurchase Notice shall specify:
- (a) The number of unvested shares subject to repurchase;
- (b) The aggregate repurchase price (original issue price × number of shares);
- (c) The proposed closing date (not less than ten (10) nor more than twenty (20) Business Days after the Repurchase Notice);
- (d) Wire transfer instructions or other payment method.

**Closing**: The repurchase shall close on the date specified in the Repurchase Notice (the "Closing Date"). At closing:
- (a) The Company shall pay the aggregate repurchase price in immediately available funds by wire transfer, certified check, or cashier's check;
- (b) The Founder shall deliver the share certificates (or execute electronic transfer instructions if shares are held electronically) duly endorsed for transfer, together with executed stock transfer instruments in the form required by the Company's share registrar;
- (c) The Company shall update the register of members to reflect the transfer.

**Deliveries**: The Founder shall execute stock transfer forms and any other instruments reasonably requested to effect the repurchase and update the share register; legends shall be updated to reflect the repurchase.

**Failure to Deliver**: If the Founder fails to deliver transfer instruments or share certificates within five (5) Business Days after the Closing Date, the Company may:
- (a) Place the aggregate repurchase price in an interest-bearing escrow account maintained by a licensed escrow agent or the Company's legal counsel for the Founder's benefit; and
- (b) Make a book entry in the register of members transferring the shares to the Company, which book entry shall be effective to transfer legal and beneficial ownership and to cancel the Founder's share certificates.

**Escrow Alternative**: The Company may, at its option and by written agreement with the Founder at the time of issuance, require that unvested Founder Shares be held in escrow with an independent escrow agent (or the Company's legal counsel as escrow agent) together with an undated stock power or share transfer instrument pending vesting. If shares are held in escrow, the escrow agent shall release shares to the Company upon receipt of a Repurchase Notice and confirmation of payment of the repurchase price to the Founder.

**Automatic Lapse**: The Company's repurchase right shall automatically lapse as shares vest. The Company's failure to deliver a Repurchase Notice within ten (10) Business Days after termination of service shall constitute an irrevocable waiver of the repurchase right for those unvested shares, unless the Founder agrees in writing to extend the notice period.

**Death or Disability Exception**: Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Founder's termination of service is due to death or permanent disability (inability to perform essential functions for more than 120 consecutive days, as certified by a licensed physician), then **one hundred percent (100%)** of the Founder's unvested shares shall immediately vest and shall **not** be subject to the Company's repurchase right.

**Solvency**: Any repurchase shall comply with the solvency requirements of the Cayman Islands Companies Act (as revised). The Board shall certify that immediately following the repurchase, the Company will be able to pay its debts as they become due and the value of the Company's assets will exceed its liabilities.

**Waiver**: The Board may waive, defer, or partially exercise the repurchase right by written resolution, provided that any such waiver is documented in Board minutes and does not discriminate among similarly situated Founders without reasonable business justification.

## 2. Drag-Along; Minority Protections

**2.1 Drag-Along Right**

If (i) holders of at least seventy-five percent (75%) of the voting power (calculated on a
votes-cast basis) and (ii) holders of a majority of the outstanding Class B shares, voting
as a separate class, approve a sale of the Company pursuant to Section 10.2 (Liquidity
Events), all Shareholders agree to sell on the same terms, subject to customary carve-outs
for tag-along rights and the minority protections set forth below.

**2.2 Minority Appraisal Rights and Independent Valuation**

To protect minority shareholders from squeeze-out at unfair prices, the following appraisal
rights and valuation protections apply:

**(a) Dissenting Shareholder Appraisal Rights**: Any Shareholder holding less than ten percent
(10%) of the Company's outstanding Shares (a "Minority Shareholder") who objects to a
drag-along sale may elect to exercise appraisal rights by delivering written notice to the
Company within ten (10) Business Days after receipt of the drag-along notice.

**(b) Independent Valuation**: If any Minority Shareholder exercises appraisal rights, the
Company shall engage an independent valuation firm (Big 4 accounting firm or recognized
investment bank with M&A valuation expertise) to determine the fair market value ("FMV") of
the Shares as of the date of the proposed sale. The valuation firm shall be jointly selected
by the Company and the dissenting Minority Shareholders within five (5) Business Days; failing
agreement, each side shall appoint one firm, and the two firms shall jointly appoint a third
firm whose valuation shall be binding.

**(c) Valuation Standard**: The independent valuation shall determine FMV using accepted
valuation methodologies (discounted cash flow, comparable company analysis, precedent
transactions, and/or other methodologies appropriate for the Company's stage and industry),
and shall be completed within thirty (30) days of the valuer's appointment.

**(d) Election to Sell or Receive FMV**: Within ten (10) Business Days after receipt of the
independent valuation, each dissenting Minority Shareholder may elect either to:
- (i) Participate in the drag-along sale at the offered price; or
- (ii) Require the acquiring party (or, if the acquiring party declines, the dragging
  Shareholders pro-rata based on their ownership) to purchase the dissenting Minority
  Shareholder's Shares at the higher of (A) the FMV determined by the independent valuation,
  or (B) the per-share price offered in the drag-along sale.

**(e) Cost Allocation**: The cost of the independent valuation shall be borne by the Company;
provided, however, that if the independent valuation determines that the drag-along sale price
was within ten percent (10%) of FMV, the dissenting Minority Shareholders shall reimburse the
Company pro-rata for the valuation cost.

**(f) No Delay**: Exercise of appraisal rights shall not delay or prevent the closing of the
drag-along sale. The drag-along sale shall close as scheduled, with the dissenting Minority
Shareholders' Shares placed in escrow pending final determination of FMV and payment.

## 3. Tag-Along

- If a Founder sells more than 10% of their Shares, other Shareholders
shall have the right to participate pro-rata.

For clarity, any tag‑along (co‑sale) rights granted in any investor side letter shall be
interpreted consistently with this Section 3 and shall not expand the scope, priority, or
participation mechanics beyond those provided herein. In the event of any inconsistency between
this Shareholders Agreement and any investor side letter, this Shareholders Agreement shall control.

## 4. Restrictions on Transfer; Right of First Refusal (ROFR)

- No Shareholder may transfer Shares without offering them first to the
Company and then to other Shareholders.

Any right of first refusal granted in any investor side letter shall be interpreted
consistently with this Section 4 and shall not limit the priority of the Company's ROFR and
the pro‑rata secondary ROFR of the Shareholders as set forth herein. In the event of any
inconsistency between this Shareholders Agreement and any investor side letter, this
Shareholders Agreement shall control.

## 5. Intellectual Property Assignment

- IP Centralization in Cayman: All Shareholders, employees, contractors, and Group Companies agree that all intellectual property ("IP") created in connection with Group business shall be and remain owned by Ai‑First Holdings Ltd. (Cayman). Each person or entity creating IP shall promptly assign, and hereby agrees to assign, such IP to Ai‑First Holdings Ltd. (Cayman).
- Intercompany Licensing: Ai‑First Holdings Ltd. (Cayman) shall license such IP to U.S. and EU operating entities (including Ai‑First Inc. (Delaware) and Ai‑First Spain, S.L.) under arm’s‑length intercompany license agreements consistent with transfer pricing policies.
- No Transfers Outside Group: Any transfer, exclusive license, or encumbrance of core IP outside the Group requires approval as a Reserved Matter and Class B consent.

## 5A. Pre‑Emptive and Founder Super Pro‑Rata Participation

- Pre‑Emptive Right: Each Shareholder shall have the right (but not the obligation) to
  purchase its pro‑rata portion of any New Securities (as defined herein) proposed to be
  issued by the Company, in order to maintain its fully‑diluted ownership percentage,
  subject to customary exclusions and the procedures set forth in the Equity Issuance
  Procedure Appendix (Appendix A — Pre‑emptive and Super Pro‑Rata).

- Founder Super Pro‑Rata: In any priced equity financing, the Founders collectively may
  subscribe for up to ten percent (10%) of the Securities offered, inclusive of and in
  excess of any pre‑emptive rights, allocated among the Founders pro‑rata to their
  fully‑diluted ownership immediately prior to such financing unless otherwise agreed in
  writing by the Founders.

- Subordination with Minimum Allocation Guarantee: The Founder super pro‑rata is subordinate to (i) the pro‑rata participation rights of Major Investors, and (ii) the Lead Investor's minimum allocation of not less than seventy percent (70%) of the round, in each case as designated by the Board in the applicable Offer Notice; **provided, however**, that notwithstanding such subordination, the Founders collectively shall be entitled to subscribe for a **minimum of five percent (5%)** of the Securities offered in any priced equity financing round (the "Founder Minimum Allocation"), regardless of Lead Investor or Major Investor allocations. The Founder Minimum Allocation shall be allocated among Founders pro-rata to their fully-diluted ownership immediately prior to the financing. If the Lead Investor's minimum allocation (70%) or Major Investors' pro-rata rights would reduce the Founders' collective allocation below 5%, the Lead Investor's allocation shall be reduced proportionally to accommodate the Founder Minimum Allocation.

- No Delay/Shortfall: Exercise of Founder super pro‑rata shall not reduce the primary
  capital below the target raise amount or delay the closing.

- Applicability: Applies to priced equity rounds (including preferred equity). SAFEs and
  convertible notes are excluded unless expressly included in the Offer Notice.

- Sunset: The Founder super pro‑rata right expires upon the closing of the Company’s first
  Series A financing (as defined herein) unless extended by Board and Class B consent.

- Procedure: Elections, timing, allocation waterfall, and compliance mechanics shall be as
  operationalized in Appendix A (file: `ExportBlock-8dac0805-4724-4e5c-900b-c9bfe0d0963f-Part-1/ESOP Equity/Equity Issuance Procedure Appendix.md`).

## 8bis. Class B Anti‑Dilution Protection

- Voting Power Maintenance: If, following any issuance of New Securities, the aggregate voting
  power of all outstanding Class B shares would represent less than fifty‑one percent (51%) of
  the total voting power of all outstanding shares (calculated on a fully diluted, votes‑cast
  basis), then the votes per share attributable to Class B shall automatically adjust upward to
  the minimum ratio necessary to maintain Class B voting power at fifty‑one percent (51%),
  rounded to the nearest whole number.

- Worked Example: If Founders hold 1,000,000 Class B shares and Investors hold 2,000,000 Class A
  shares, the Class B ratio adjusts from 10:1 to 21:1 (1,000,000 × 21 = 21,000,000 votes ≈ 51.2%
  versus 2,000,000 × 1 = 2,000,000 votes).

- Notice and Certification: Within five (5) Business Days of any equity issuance, the Company
  shall calculate and certify to all shareholders the adjusted Class B voting ratio, if any, and
  shall update the Articles/M&A and member register accordingly.

- Cap: Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Class B voting ratio shall not exceed one hundred (100)
  votes per share; if an adjustment would exceed this cap, the Company must either implement an
  alternative mechanism to preserve founder control or obtain Class B consent to proceed with
  the dilutive issuance.

## 6. Reserved Matters and Deadlock Resolution

### Reserved Matters
The following matters require approval of a majority of Founders and the affirmative vote of holders of a majority of Class B shares (if applicable):
- Appointment or removal of the CEO; approval of an annual budget or any revision exceeding the previously approved budget by more than fifteen (15)% or any single capital expenditure above USD/EUR 250,000 outside the approved budget.
- Issuance of new equity or debt convertible into equity; changes to Class A/B rights.
- Transfer or encumbrance of core IP; amendments to governing documents.

### Deadlock and Casting Vote
If a deadlock arises among Founders on any Reserved Matter after good‑faith negotiation for ten (10) Business Days, the Founder Chair (currently, Travis Sheppard) shall have a casting vote solely to resolve that Reserved Matter. The casting vote shall not apply where the Founder Chair is conflicted; in such case, the matter shall be referred to an Independent Director or, failing that, to mediation pursuant to the rules of the American Arbitration Association. Any decision under this Section shall be recorded in writing and appended to the minutes of the applicable meeting.

## 7. Founder Protections; Appointment and Removal

### Board Composition and Appointment Rights
- The Board shall include at all times at least one Founder‑appointed Director. Vacancies in any Founder‑appointed seat shall be filled exclusively by designees of the Founder holders of a majority of Class B shares.

### Removal Only for Cause
- The Founder‑appointed Director and the Chair may be removed only for "Cause" by (i) a vote of at least two‑thirds (2/3) of the Directors then in office and (ii) the affirmative vote of holders of a majority of outstanding Class B shares, voting as a separate class. "Cause" means: (a) conviction of a felony involving moral turpitude; (b) fraud or willful misconduct that results in material harm to the Company; or (c) material breach of fiduciary duty or this Agreement that remains uncured for thirty (30) days after written notice.

### Quorum for Reserved Matters
- Quorum for any Board vote on a Reserved Matter requires the presence (in person or by electronic means) of at least one Founder‑appointed Director.

## 8. Pre‑Emptive and Super Pro‑Rata Rights (Founders)
- In any new issuance of equity or securities convertible into equity, each Founder shall have
  pre‑emptive rights to purchase their pro‑rata share to maintain ownership, and an additional
  super pro‑rata right to purchase up to an extra ten percent (10%) of the round (subject to
  applicable securities laws and the subordination/guardrails in Section 5A). The Company
  shall provide at least ten (10) Business Days’ prior written notice of any such issuance.
 - The detailed process, timelines, and allocation waterfall are set forth in Appendix A — Equity Issuance Procedure, incorporated herein by reference.

## 9. Investor Voting Covenant
- Each Investor agrees to vote, or cause to be voted, their Shares at each meeting or action by written consent to elect the Founder slate of Directors (including the Founder‑appointed Director) and designate Travis Sheppard as Chair of the Board until the earliest of: (i) the fifth (5th) anniversary of the date of the relevant financing; (ii) a Qualified IPO; (iii) the Founder holders of Class B Shares collectively owning less than fifteen percent (15%) of the Company's fully diluted share capital; or (iv) written termination by mutual consent of the Company and the Founder holders of a majority of Class B shares, unless earlier removed for Cause pursuant to this Agreement.

## 10. Dividends and Liquidity Events

### 10.1 Dividends Policy
No dividends shall be declared or paid prior to completion of a bona fide Series A equity financing (the "Series A"). Following the Series A, any dividends shall be subject to Board approval and applicable law.

### 10.2 Liquidity Events; Board Approval and Class B Consent
Any Liquidity Event (being any merger, consolidation, sale of substantially all assets, share sale resulting in a change of control, or dissolution) must be approved by the Board and shall constitute a Reserved Matter requiring the separate consent of holders of a majority of Class B shares as set forth herein.

## 10. Buy–Sell; Deadlock Exit Mechanism (Shotgun or FMV)

### 10.3 Triggers; Eligible Initiators
This Section may be invoked only by a Founder holding Class B shares and solely with respect
to Shares then held by Founders. Triggers are limited to: (a) a deadlock on any Reserved
Matter persisting for ten (10) Business Days after completion of the process in Section 6;
(b) a material, uncured breach of this Agreement by a Founder after thirty (30) days’ written
notice; or (c) a Founder’s permanent disability or voluntary departure. For the avoidance of
doubt, Investors and any non‑Founder holders are not eligible to initiate or compel a
transaction under this Section, and Shares held by non‑Founders are excluded from the
mechanism.

### 10.4 Shotgun Procedure (Russian Roulette); Good Faith and Guardrails

**10.4.1 Good Faith Offer Price Requirement**

The Initiating Founder must determine the Offer Price in good faith based on the Company's most recent valuation (409A valuation, independent fair market value appraisal, or financing round valuation) or other objective indicia of value. The Offer Price shall not be grossly below fair market value for the purpose of forcing a sale at an unconscionable price.

Any Offer Price that is more than **thirty percent (30%)** below the most recent independent valuation (if obtained within the prior twelve (12) months) shall be **presumed not to be in good faith** and may be challenged by the recipient Founder as set forth in Section 10.4.4 below.

**10.4.2 Buy-Sell Notice and Election**

Any Founder (the "Initiating Founder") may deliver a Buy–Sell Notice stating a per‑share Offer Price. The Buy-Sell Notice shall include:
- (a) The Offer Price per share;
- (b) The total number of Founder-held Shares held by the Initiating Founder;
- (c) The basis for determining the Offer Price (e.g., reference to most recent 409A valuation, independent FMV appraisal dated [DATE], Series [X] financing round at $[Y] per share, or other objective indicia);
- (d) A representation that the Initiating Founder has determined the Offer Price in good faith and that the Offer Price is not more than 30% below the most recent independent valuation (if any obtained within prior 12 months).

Within ten (10) Business Days after receipt of the Buy-Sell Notice, the recipient Founder(s) must elect either to:
- (i) **Sell** all of their Founder‑held Shares to the Initiating Founder at the Offer Price; or
- (ii) **Purchase** all of the Initiating Founder's Founder‑held Shares at the Offer Price.

Failure to respond within ten (10) Business Days is deemed an election to sell.

**10.4.3 Financing Extension**

If the recipient Founder reasonably demonstrates that a bona fide third-party financing process is underway (by providing a term sheet from a lender or equity investor, or a commitment letter, or evidence of active negotiations with a financial institution), the election period and closing period shall each be extended by up to an additional thirty (30) Business Days to accommodate completion of such financing.

The recipient must provide evidence of the financing process within five (5) Business Days after receipt of the Buy-Sell Notice to qualify for the extension.

**10.4.4 Judicial Review; Good Faith and Proportionality (Spanish Law Compliance)**

This shotgun mechanism is subject to the principles of **good faith** (buena fe) and **proportionality** under Spanish Civil Code Article 1258 and general principles of Spanish contract law and corporate law. Either party may apply to a court of competent jurisdiction (or to the arbitrator designated under Section 12, Dispute Resolution) for relief if:

**(a)** The Offer Price is **manifestly unfair or unconscionable** (lesión under Spanish Civil Code Article 1293), meaning the Offer Price grossly undervalues the Shares in light of objective evidence of value;

**(b)** The Initiating Founder has acted in **bad faith** or abused the shotgun mechanism to exploit the recipient's temporary illiquidity, lack of financing, or other disadvantageous circumstance;

**(c)** The mechanism would result in a **grossly unjust outcome** contrary to Spanish public policy (orden público under Spanish Civil Code Article 6.3) or principles of equity.

The court or arbitrator may, in its discretion:
- (i) **Refuse to enforce** the shotgun and order a buy-out at Fair Market Value determined in accordance with Section 10.5;
- (ii) **Adjust the Offer Price** to fair market value as determined by an independent valuation;
- (iii) **Extend the timeline** to permit the recipient to secure financing on reasonable terms;
- (iv) Grant such **other relief** as is just and equitable under the circumstances.

**10.4.5 Closing**

Closing shall occur within twenty (20) Business Days after the recipient's election (or deemed election to sell), subject to customary transfer documentation and any financing extension under Section 10.4.3. At closing:
- (a) The purchasing Founder shall pay the aggregate purchase price (Offer Price × number of Shares) in accordance with Section 10.6;
- (b) The selling Founder shall execute and deliver duly endorsed share certificates (or electronic transfer instructions) and all transfer instruments required by the Company's share registrar;
- (c) The parties shall execute representations limited to title and authority as set forth in Section 10.6.

### 10.5 Fair Market Value Alternative
If a shotgun mechanism is prohibited by applicable law or not elected, any Founder may require a buy‑out at Fair Market Value (“FMV”). FMV shall be determined by an independent valuation firm jointly appointed; failing agreement within five (5) Business Days, each side appoints one valuer, who jointly appoint a third; FMV is the average of the two closest valuations. Valuation timeline: 20 Business Days from appointment. Closing: within 20 Business Days after FMV is fixed.

### 10.6 Payment; Mechanics
Consideration may be cash or a combination of cash and a secured note of up to eighteen (18)
months, bearing interest at eight percent (8%) per annum, with a first‑priority pledge over
the purchased Shares until paid in full. Interest shall not exceed the maximum rate permitted
by applicable law; if any amount contracted for, charged, or received would exceed such
maximum, the rate shall be deemed reduced to such maximum and any excess paid shall be
credited against principal. Following an event of default, interest shall accrue at the
stated rate plus three percent (3%) per annum until cured or paid in full. The note may be
prepaid in whole or in part at any time without premium or penalty. Parties shall execute
standard share transfer forms and representations limited to title and authority (no
business warranties).

### 10.7 Overrides; Compliance; Mandatory Law
Transfers under this Section are permitted transfers among Founders and shall be recognized by
the Company upon delivery of closing documents, subject to applicable securities laws. Nothing
herein limits drag‑along/tag‑along provisions. For avoidance of doubt, this Section does not
override any mandatory pre‑emptive, consent, or transfer restrictions applicable to
non‑Founder holders under applicable law or the Company’s governing documents.

### 10.8 Confidentiality and Non‑Disparagement
The parties shall keep the terms and negotiations under this Section confidential and refrain from public statements except as required by law.

### 11.1 Board Size and Composition (Pre‑IPO)
Prior to a Qualified IPO, any change to the size or composition of the Board (including elimination or reclassification of seats, creation/elimination of observer rights materially affecting governance, or committee reconstitution that removes Founder control over Reserved Matters) shall be a Reserved Matter requiring the separate consent of holders of a majority of Class B shares, and shall in all cases maintain at least one Founder‑appointed Director seat.

Any amendment, reclassification, or conversion affecting these rights (other than voluntary conversion of Class B into Class A at the option of the holder) shall be a Reserved Matter requiring the separate consent of holders of a majority of Class B shares.

### 11.4 Founder Schedule and Cap Table Labeling
The Company shall maintain an internal register and fully diluted capitalization table that
identifies Founders and flags Founder‑held Shares for administrative purposes, including the

### 12.1 Carve-Out for Spanish Employment and Labor Disputes

Notwithstanding the arbitration provisions above, any dispute, claim, or controversy arising out of or relating to employment relationships, labor matters, or employment contracts governed by Spanish law (including but not limited to claims under the Estatuto de los Trabajadores, Ley de Sociedades de Capital employment provisions, or Spanish social security law) shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Spanish labor courts (Juzgados de lo Social) in the place where the services are rendered or where the employee has their habitual place of work, in accordance with Spanish procedural law (Ley Reguladora de la Jurisdicción Social, Ley 36/2011).

For the avoidance of doubt, this carve-out applies only to disputes arising from individual or collective employment relationships subject to Spanish labor law and does not affect the arbitration of corporate governance, shareholder, or commercial disputes under this Agreement.
### Post‑Series A Threshold Adjustments
- Following completion of a bona fide Series A financing (as defined herein), the Board may, by written resolution, adjust the quantitative governance thresholds in this Agreement (including the annual budget variance percentage and the single capital expenditure threshold) to reflect the Company’s operational scale; provided that any such adjustment shall require the separate consent of holders of a majority of the outstanding Class B shares, voting as a separate class, and shall not diminish the substantive protections afforded to Class B without such consent.
- Any approved adjustment shall be documented by (i) a Board resolution, and (ii) either an amendment to this Agreement or an appended schedule referencing the updated thresholds. A template Board resolution is provided at: `ExportBlock-8dac0805-4724-4e5c-900b-c9bfe0d0963f-Part-1/Governance/Board Resolution Template - Post-Series A Threshold Adjustment.md`.
