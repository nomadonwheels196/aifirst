### 3.1 Initial Ownership

Each Founder shall be issued shares in the Company as follows:

| Founder | Class of Shares | % Ownership | Purchase Price per Share |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Travis Sheppard | Class B Ordinary | [20]% | $0.0001 |
| Miguel Romera | Class A Ordinary | [20]% | $0.0001 |

> 

## Definitions
- Business Day: has the meaning set forth in the Company’s Shareholders Agreement.
- Change of Control: has the meaning set forth in the Company’s Shareholders Agreement.
- Reverse Vesting: has the meaning set forth in the Company’s Shareholders Agreement.
- Vesting Commencement Date: the date the Founder commences full‑time service with the Company.
- Cliff: the initial period during which no shares vest, after which a specified portion vests immediately.

### 3.2 Vesting Schedule

All Founder shares are subject to a four (4) year vesting schedule with a one (1) year
cliff. Twenty-five percent (25%) shall vest on the first anniversary of the Vesting
Commencement Date (the "Cliff"), and the remaining seventy-five percent (75%) shall vest in
equal monthly installments over the subsequent thirty-six (36) months, subject to the
Founder's continued service to the Company.

Unvested shares shall be subject to repurchase by the Company at nominal value in the event
of departure. In the event of any conflict between this Agreement and the Founder Stock
Purchase Agreement regarding vesting terms, the vesting schedule set forth in this Section
3.2 shall control.

### 3.3 Acceleration

In the event of a **Change of Control** (as defined in the Shareholders Agreement), 50% of all unvested shares shall accelerate immediately, with the remainder continuing to vest over the next 12 months provided the Founder remains in service.

### **3.4 Reverse Vesting and Repurchase Right**

**3.4.1 Repurchase Right**

All Founder Shares shall be subject to **reverse vesting**, meaning that each Founder shall be the legal owner of all such shares from the date of issuance; however, the **Company shall retain an irrevocable right to repurchase** any unvested shares upon termination of service for any reason, including resignation, termination with or without cause, or voluntary departure.

**3.4.2 Repurchase Price**

The repurchase price for unvested Founder Shares shall be the **original issue price** paid by the Founder (the "Issue Price"), which shall be the par value or nominal value of the shares unless the Founder paid a higher price at issuance. For the avoidance of doubt:

(a) "Original issue price" means the price per share actually paid by the Founder in cash or other consideration upon initial issuance of the shares as documented in the Founder Stock Purchase Agreement or share subscription agreement;

(b) If shares were issued for services or for nominal/par value consideration, the original issue price shall be deemed to be the par value ($0.0001 per share for Class A and Class B Ordinary Shares);

(c) The repurchase price shall **not** be adjusted for fair market value appreciation, subsequent financing rounds, or any independent valuation of the Company;

(d) Any shares acquired by a Founder in a secondary transaction (i.e., other than original issuance under this Agreement or the Founder Stock Purchase Agreement) are excluded from the reverse vesting repurchase mechanism unless expressly subjected to reverse vesting by written agreement.

**3.4.3 Procedure and Timeline**

(a) **Notice**: Within ten (10) Business Days after a Founder's termination of service, the Company may deliver written notice to the Founder (or the Founder's legal representative or estate) of its election to exercise the repurchase right (the "Repurchase Notice"). The Repurchase Notice shall specify:
- (i) The number of unvested shares subject to repurchase;
- (ii) The aggregate repurchase price (Issue Price × number of shares);
- (iii) The proposed closing date (not less than ten (10) nor more than twenty (20) Business Days after the Repurchase Notice);
- (iv) Wire transfer instructions or other payment method.

(b) **Closing**: The repurchase shall close on the date specified in the Repurchase Notice (the "Closing Date"). At closing:
- (i) The Company shall pay the aggregate repurchase price in immediately available funds by wire transfer, certified check, or cashier's check;
- (ii) The Founder shall deliver the share certificates (or execute electronic transfer instructions if shares are held electronically) duly endorsed for transfer, together with executed stock transfer instruments in the form required by the Company's share registrar;
- (iii) The Company shall update the register of members to reflect the transfer.

(c) **Failure to Deliver Shares**: If the Founder fails to deliver the shares or execute required transfer instruments within five (5) Business Days after the Closing Date, the Company may:
- (i) Place the aggregate repurchase price in an interest-bearing escrow account maintained by a licensed escrow agent or the Company's legal counsel for the Founder's benefit; and
- (ii) Make a book entry in the register of members transferring the shares to the Company, which book entry shall be effective to transfer legal and beneficial ownership and to cancel the Founder's share certificates.

(d) **Escrow Alternative**: The Company may, at its option and by written agreement with the Founder at the time of issuance, require that unvested Founder Shares be held in escrow with an independent escrow agent (or the Company's legal counsel as escrow agent) together with an undated stock power or share transfer instrument pending vesting. If shares are held in escrow, the escrow agent shall release shares to the Company upon receipt of a Repurchase Notice and confirmation of payment of the repurchase price to the Founder.

**3.4.4 Automatic Lapse**

The Company's repurchase right shall **automatically lapse** as shares vest according to the vesting schedule in Section 3.2. The Company's failure to deliver a Repurchase Notice within ten (10) Business Days after termination of service shall constitute an irrevocable waiver of the repurchase right for those unvested shares, unless the Founder agrees in writing to extend the notice period.

**3.4.5 Death or Disability Exception**

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Founder's termination of service is due to:
- (a) **Death**: The Founder's death; or
- (b) **Permanent Disability**: The Founder's inability to perform the essential functions of their role for a period of more than one hundred twenty (120) consecutive days due to physical or mental incapacity, as certified by a licensed physician;

then **one hundred percent (100%)** of the Founder's unvested shares shall immediately vest and shall **not** be subject to the Company's repurchase right. The accelerated vesting under this Section 3.4.5 is in addition to any other acceleration provisions in this Agreement.

**3.4.6 Solvency and Authorization**

Any repurchase of shares shall comply with the solvency requirements of the Cayman Islands Companies Act (as revised). The Board of Directors shall certify in writing (which may be included in the Repurchase Notice or in Board minutes) that:
- (a) The repurchase is authorized by the Company's Memorandum and Articles of Association;
- (b) Immediately following the repurchase, the Company will be able to pay its debts as they become due in the ordinary course of business; and
- (c) The value of the Company's assets will exceed its liabilities (including contingent liabilities) immediately after the repurchase.

If the Board cannot make such certification, the Company shall not proceed with the repurchase.

**3.4.7 Tax Treatment and Acknowledgment**

Founders acknowledge that:
- (a) The repurchase at Issue Price may have tax consequences in the Founder's jurisdiction of tax residence (including potential ordinary income, capital gain/loss, or deemed dividend treatment);
- (b) The Company makes no representations or warranties regarding the tax treatment of the repurchase in any jurisdiction;
- (c) Each Founder is solely responsible for consulting their own tax advisors regarding the tax consequences of the reverse vesting structure and any repurchase; and
- (d) For US tax purposes, the repurchase may be treated as a non-recognition transaction, a sale, or compensation for services, depending on the facts and circumstances and applicable tax law.

**(a) US Founders**: Any Founder who is a US citizen or tax resident and who performs substantial services for Ai-First Inc. (Delaware) shall execute an employment agreement with Ai-First Inc. and shall be classified as a common-law employee for US federal and state tax purposes, with all applicable tax withholding. The Board shall determine appropriate officer titles and duties.

### 4bis.6 Coordination with Equity Grants

For purposes of equity compensation under the Company's ESOP or any other equity incentive plan:

**(a)** Founders who are classified as employees of an operating subsidiary shall be eligible for employee-only equity grants (e.g., Incentive Stock Options under IRC §422) in accordance with applicable law and plan terms;

**(b)** Founders who provide services exclusively as Directors or independent contractors shall be eligible only for non-employee equity grants (e.g., Non-Qualified Stock Options); and

**(c)** The Administrator of any equity plan shall verify employment status before making any grant to ensure compliance with securities laws and tax requirements.

## 5. Decision-Making

- **Major decisions** (e.g., financing, mergers, new share issuance, sale of IP) require unanimous Founder consent until external investors hold >25% of the Company.
- After that point, such decisions shall follow Board approval per the Shareholders' Agreement and Cayman M&A.

title, and interest in and to all Intellectual Property (as defined below) conceived,
created, developed, or reduced to practice by such Founder, solely or jointly with others,

hours or using Company resources. "Intellectual Property" means all patents, patent
applications, copyrights, trade secrets, trademarks, mask works, inventions, discoveries,
improvements, ideas, algorithms, software code, designs, know-how, and any other

assignments, copyright registrations, and declarations. This assignment is effective
immediately upon creation of the Intellectual Property and does not require further action
by the Founder, though the Founder agrees to cooperate with documentation requests. For any

represents that such Intellectual Property is either (i) assigned to the Company pursuant to
a separate written agreement, or (ii) excluded from this assignment pursuant to Schedule A
hereto.

## 11. Governing Law

This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the Cayman
Islands, without regard to conflicts of law principles. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
parties acknowledge that (i) any employment relationship between a Founder and the Company
or its subsidiaries shall be subject to the mandatory employment laws of the jurisdiction
where such employment services are performed, and (ii) the enforceability of restrictive
covenants in Sections 8 and 9 shall be determined under the laws of the jurisdiction where
