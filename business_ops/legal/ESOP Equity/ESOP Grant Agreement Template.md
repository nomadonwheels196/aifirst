### 3A. ISO/NSO Split (US Taxpayers; IRC §422(d))
To the extent required by Internal Revenue Code §422(d), the portion of this option intended
to qualify as an Incentive Stock Option (ISO) is limited to shares having an aggregate Fair
Market Value (determined at the grant date) that first become exercisable in any calendar
year not exceeding USD $100,000. Accordingly, this grant is classified as follows:
- ISO Portion: [•] shares
- NSO Portion (excess over $100,000 annual ISO limit): [•] shares

ISOs shall be deemed to become exercisable in order of grant date. Any portion exercised
more than ninety (90) days after termination of employment (other than due to death or
disability) will be treated as an NSO to the extent required by law.

### 3B. Early Exercise (If Permitted)
Early Exercise Permitted: Yes

If "Yes": Participant may exercise all or part of the option that is unvested. Shares issued
upon Early Exercise remain unvested restricted shares subject to the vesting schedule stated
above. The Company shall have an irrevocable right to repurchase any unvested shares upon
termination of service at a price per share equal to the exercise price paid; such right
lapses as shares vest. Participant agrees to execute a stock power and to permit the Company
to hold unvested shares (and related documents) in escrow until vesting or repurchase. US
taxpayers are solely responsible for any §83(b) election within 30 days of the Early
Exercise and for providing a copy to the Company.

For Early Exercises of unvested shares, US taxpayers acknowledge the availability and risks
of a timely §83(b) election and agree that failure to file within 30 days may result in
ordinary income recognition upon vesting.

## 7. Miscellaneous
