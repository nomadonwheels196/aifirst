## Ai‑First Inc. (Delaware C‑Corp) – Restricted Stock Purchase Agreement

This Restricted Stock Purchase Agreement (this "Agreement") is made as of [Date] by and
between **Ai‑First Inc.**, a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), and [Purchaser Name]
(the "Purchaser").

1. Purchase and Sale of Shares
- Shares: [X] shares of Company Common Stock
- Purchase Price: $0.0001 per share (par value)
- Payment: Paid in cash (or as otherwise approved by the Board)

2. Vesting; Reverse Vesting Repurchase Right
- Vesting: Twenty‑five percent (25%) of the Shares shall vest on the first anniversary of
  the Vesting Commencement Date; the remaining seventy‑five percent (75%) shall vest in
  equal monthly installments over the subsequent thirty‑six (36) months, subject to the
  Purchaser’s continued service to the Company.
- Repurchase Right: The Company shall have the irrevocable right to repurchase any unvested
  Shares at the original purchase price upon termination of service for any reason. The
  repurchase right lapses as Shares vest. The Company may exercise the repurchase right by
  written notice within ninety (90) days after termination.

3. 83(b) Election (US Taxpayers)
**IMPORTANT TAX NOTICE:** If you are a US taxpayer, consult a tax advisor immediately
regarding the advisability of filing an election under Section 83(b) of the US Internal
Revenue Code. This election must be filed with the IRS within thirty (30) days of the
purchase date; the deadline is not extendable. Failure to file timely may result in
ordinary income recognition at each vesting date based on the then‑current fair market
value of the Shares. The Purchaser is responsible for filing any such election and for
providing a copy to the Company for its records.

4. Transfer Restrictions; Legends

- Appropriate equitable adjustments shall be made in the event of stock splits,
  consolidations, or similar transactions.

  Shares, including voting and dividends, subject to this Agreement.

7. Ownership of IP; Group Alignment

  that the Company’s rights are derived under intercompany license(s). Nothing in this
  Agreement alters such Group IP structure.

8. Governing Law; Dispute Resolution
- Governing Law: State of Delaware.
- Dispute Resolution: Any dispute arising out of or relating to this Agreement shall be
  resolved by binding arbitration administered by JAMS under its Streamlined Rules, seated
  in Wilmington, Delaware, before a single arbitrator. Each party bears its own attorneys’
  fees and costs unless otherwise awarded.
