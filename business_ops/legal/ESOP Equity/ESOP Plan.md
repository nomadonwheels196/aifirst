---

---

## 4. Grant of Options

- **Restricted Stock Units (RSUs)** – right to receive shares after vesting

- **Performance-Based Options** – tied to defined KPIs or milestones

### 4.2 Grant Price

The exercise price shall not be less than the **fair market value (FMV)** of the Company's ordinary shares at the time of grant.

**For U.S. Taxpayers**: FMV **must** be determined exclusively by reference to an independent IRC §409A valuation in accordance with the mandatory requirements set forth in US Sub-Plan Section 3. No other valuation method is permitted for U.S. taxpayer grants.

**For Non-U.S. Taxpayers**: FMV shall be determined in good faith by the Board in accordance with applicable local law and the relevant sub-plan.

### 4.3 Grant Agreement

Each participant shall receive a **Grant Agreement** specifying:
- Number of options or units granted

- Exercise price

- Vesting schedule

- Expiry date

## 5. Vesting and Exercise

### 5.1 Standard Vesting Schedule

Unless otherwise specified:
- 4-year vesting with a 1-year cliff

- 25% of the award vests after 12 months of continuous service

- The remaining 75% vests in equal monthly installments over the subsequent
  thirty-six (36) months

### 5.2 Accelerated Vesting

Acceleration provisions apply as follows:
- **50%** vesting acceleration upon **Change of Control**

- **100%** acceleration upon **termination without cause** or **resignation for good reason** following a Change of Control

### 5.3 Exercise Period

Options may be exercised up to **10 years** from the date of grant, or within **90 days** following termination of employment (unless terminated for cause).

---

## 6. Change of Control

In the event of a merger, acquisition, or sale of substantially all assets:
- The Board may substitute or cash out outstanding options at fair value.

- Any unvested options may accelerate at the Board’s discretion.

For purposes of this Plan, "Change of Control" means, within any twelve (12) month period:
(i) any person or group becomes the beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of more than
fifty percent (50%) of the total voting power of the Company's outstanding voting securities;
(ii) a sale, transfer, or disposition of more than fifty percent (50%) of the Company's
assets (measured by fair market value); (iii) a merger, consolidation, or similar
reorganization after which the holders of the Company's voting securities immediately prior
to such transaction own less than fifty percent (50%) of the total voting power of the
surviving or resulting entity immediately after such transaction; (iv) during any period
of twelve (12) consecutive months, a majority of the members of the Board is replaced by
individuals whose appointment or election is not endorsed by a majority of the members of
the Board prior to the date of such appointment or election; or (v) the consummation of a
Qualified IPO (as defined in the Company's Articles of Association and Shareholders Agreement).

For the avoidance of doubt and for purposes of equity-based compensation subject to US tax law,
this definition shall be construed consistently with Treasury Regulation §1.409A-3(i)(5)
(change in ownership or effective control) and Internal Revenue Code §280G(b)(2)(A) (change
in ownership or effective control for golden parachute purposes) to the extent applicable.

This definition is harmonized with the "Change of Control" definition in the Company's
Shareholders Agreement to ensure consistency across all equity compensation and governance
documents.

## 7. Taxation

### 7.1 Cayman Parent

Options issued under the Plan are governed by Cayman law and are not subject to Cayman income tax.

### 7.2 Local Jurisdictions

Local sub-plans will comply with:
- **U.S.**: IRC §409A, ISOs/NSOs rules

- **Spain**: IRPF stock option taxation (income recognized at exercise)

- **Portugal**: Preferential treatment under startup equity incentive regulations (if applicable)

Participants are responsible for their own tax liabilities arising from the exercise or sale of shares.

### 7.3 Valuation Policy (409A Safe Harbor) — MANDATORY COMPLIANCE

**For U.S. Taxpayers — US Sub-Plan Section 3 Controls**:

All option grants to U.S. taxpayers are subject to the **mandatory** 409A compliance requirements set forth in Section 3 of the US Sub-Plan (409A; ISOs/NSOs). The provisions of US Sub-Plan Section 3 are incorporated herein by reference and supersede any conflicting provisions in this Plan.

**Key Requirements** (see US Sub-Plan Section 3 for full details):
- The Company **shall** obtain an independent IRC §409A valuation at least every twelve (12) months and within thirty (30) days following any Material Event.
- The Administrator has **no discretion** to grant options to U.S. taxpayers:
  - Below the FMV stated in the most recent 409A valuation;
  - If no current (non-stale) 409A valuation is in effect;
  - Without the required Board certification and documentation.
- If any grant or grant term under the US Sub‑Plan is determined in good faith not to comply with Code §409A (including an error in Fair Market Value determination or timing), such grant or term shall be **reformed to the extent necessary to comply with §409A**, and the Company shall take all reasonable corrective steps intended to **minimize adverse tax consequences** to the affected Participant(s), including use of any available IRS correction procedures. This provision reflects a strong compliance presumption while permitting appropriate cure.
- **No override or waiver** is permitted under any circumstances, including with tax counsel approval.

**For Non-U.S. Taxpayers**:
- FMV shall be determined in good faith by the Board in accordance with applicable local law and the relevant sub-plan.
- The Board may engage independent valuers as appropriate for non-U.S. jurisdictions.

## 8. Transfer and Termination

### 8.1 Non-Transferability

Options are personal to the participant and may not be sold, assigned, or pledged, except by will or inheritance.

### 8.2 Termination of Employment

Upon termination:
- Unvested options are forfeited immediately.

- Vested options may be exercised within 90 days, unless otherwise approved by the Board.

For Spain/EU participants, post‑termination treatment (including repurchase rights and exercise windows) shall follow the Good/Bad Leaver rules set forth in the Spain/EU Sub‑Plan.

## 9. Adjustments

If the Company undergoes any share split, consolidation, or similar event, appropriate adjustments shall be made to the number of shares and exercise prices under this Plan.
