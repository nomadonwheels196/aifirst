# Appendix A — Equity Issuance Procedure (Pre‑emptive and Super Pro‑Rata)

Created by: Travis Sheppard
Category: Corporate Legal — Equity
Status: Draft for Legal Review

## 1. Purpose and Scope
This Appendix sets the step‑by‑step procedure for any issuance of equity or securities convertible into equity ("New Securities"). It operationalizes Founders’ pre‑emptive and super pro‑rata rights and applies unless a written waiver is obtained.

## Definitions
Unless the Shareholders Agreement defines these terms otherwise, the following apply for this Appendix:
- Business Day: any day other than Saturday, Sunday, or public holiday when banks are open in the Company’s principal place of business.
- Eligible Holders: holders of Class A or Class B (and holders of options/warrants to the extent exercisable) as shown on the fully diluted cap table immediately prior to the Offer Notice.
- New Securities: any equity or instruments convertible/exercisable into equity, excluding (i) issuances under Board‑approved ESOP within the pool, (ii) exercises/conversions of outstanding securities listed on the cap table, and (iii) stock splits/dividends/recaps.

## 2. Offer Notice
- Company delivers a written Offer Notice to all Eligible Holders stating: security type, price, key terms, max amount (the "Offer"), proposed closing date, and cap table snapshot.
- Eligible Holders: existing shareholders holding Class A or Class B (and holders of options/warrants to the extent exercisable at issuance).

## 3. Election Windows
- Pre‑emptive Election Period: ten (10) Business Days from Offer Notice to elect pro‑rata participation.
- Super Pro‑Rata Election Period: five (5) Business Days after the Pre‑emptive Period to elect additional amounts (Founders only, up to ten percent (10%) of the round in aggregate).
- Funding Deadline: five (5) Business Days after Company confirmation of final allocations.

## 4. Allocation Waterfall
1) Pre‑emptive: Allocate to each Eligible Holder its pro‑rata share (based on fully diluted ownership immediately prior to the Offer).
2) Founder Super Pro‑Rata: Allocate any unsubscribed balance to Founders up to their requested super pro‑rata amounts (capped at ten percent (10%) of the round, aggregated across Founders, allocated among Founders pro‑rata to their pre‑money holdings unless otherwise agreed).

### 4A. Founder Super Pro‑Rata Guardrails (Subordination and Applicability)
- Subordination: Founder super pro‑rata is subordinate to (i) the pro‑rata participation rights of Major Investors, and (ii) the Lead Investor’s minimum allocation of not less than seventy percent (70%) of the round, in each case as designated by the Board in the Offer Notice.
- No Delay/Shortfall: Exercise of the Founder super pro‑rata shall not reduce the primary capital below the target raise amount or delay the closing.
- Allocation Among Founders: Unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Founders, any Founder super pro‑rata allocation shall be divided among Founders pro‑rata to their fully‑diluted ownership immediately prior to the Offer.
- Applicability: Applies to priced equity rounds (including preferred equity). SAFEs/convertible notes are excluded unless the Offer Notice expressly includes them.
- Sunset: This Founder super pro‑rata right expires upon the closing of the Company’s first Qualified Series A financing unless extended by Board and Class B consent.
3) Remaining Balance: Allocate to other participating investors that oversubscribed, pro‑rata to their pre‑money holdings.
4) External Placement: Any residual may be sold to new investors on terms no more favorable than those in the Offer (no >5% price discount or sweeter terms) unless the Offer is re‑opened to all Eligible Holders.

## 5. Price Protection; Changes
- If material terms (including price) improve for any third party, the Company must promptly re‑circulate a revised Offer Notice and re‑open the Election Periods.

## 6. Compliance and Funding Mechanics
- Payments in immediately available funds to the subscription account specified in the Offer Notice; closes via board‑approved subscription agreements.
- All issuances comply with applicable securities laws; investors must provide KYC/AML information as requested.

## 7. Example (Illustrative)
Round Size: 1,000,000; Unsubscribed after pre‑emptive: 300,000. Founders elect super pro‑rata totaling 200,000 (within cap) ⇒ allocate 200,000 to Founders; remaining 100,000 allocated pro‑rata among oversubscribing investors.

## 8. Conflicts; Interpretation
Where this Appendix conflicts with the Shareholders Agreement, the more protective provision for Founder pre‑emptive/super pro‑rata rights prevails, subject to law.
