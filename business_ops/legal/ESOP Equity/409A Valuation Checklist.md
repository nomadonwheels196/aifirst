## Purpose
Establish safe‑harbor fair market value (FMV) under IRC §409A for option and RSU grants to US taxpayers.

## When to Obtain/Refresh
- Initial valuation prior to first US grant
- At least every 12 months thereafter
- Upon material events: equity financing, secondary sale, M&A discussions, major revenue inflection

## Data Package for Valuer
- Cap table (pre/post option pool) and charter/docs
- Recent financings/term sheets and investor rights summaries
- Financials (historical + projections), key KPIs
- Product roadmap, competitive landscape
- Key contracts and customer concentration
- Risk factors and company‑specific discounts

## Process & Governance
- Engage independent valuation firm; confirm provider independence/conflicts
- Coordinate Board calendar to approve grants after FMV is set
- Set grant date policy (e.g., monthly grant batches following Board meetings)
- Maintain documentation: valuation report, Board minutes adopting FMV, grant approvals

## Communication & Controls
- Update grant templates with current FMV and issue date
- Train HR/finance on 30‑day 83(b) deadline for restricted stock
- Track valuation expiry and material events; trigger refresh as needed

## Deliverables
- 409A report (PDF) with conclusion of FMV
- Board consent/minutes affirming FMV and authorizing grants
- Audit‑ready file with supporting materials
