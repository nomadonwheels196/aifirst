1. Pool Size

- 15% of fully diluted capitalization reserved for employee stock
options.

2. Option Grants

- Standard vesting: 25% cliff after 1 year, remainder monthly over 36
months.

- Options granted under the Plan do not convey voting rights until
exercised.

- US Tax Note (ISOs): For US taxpayers, options intended as Incentive Stock Options are
  subject to the USD $100,000 annual limit under IRC §422(d) (FMV determined at grant) for
  shares first exercisable in any calendar year; any excess over the limit is treated as a
  Non‑Qualified Stock Option. Grant Agreements will specify any ISO/NSO split. See the US
  Sub‑Plan for operational details.

3. Termination

- If employment ends, unvested options are forfeited. Vested options
must be exercised within 90 days.

4. Administration

- The Board (or Compensation Committee) of Ai‑First Holdings Ltd. (Cayman) administers the Global ESOP and its sub‑plans.

Grant Documents: Awards are documented using the ESOP Grant Agreement Template, which references the applicable sub‑plan and the current 409A FMV (for U.S. taxpayers):

## Definitions

**“Vesting Commencement Date”** means the date of the Founder’s commencement of full-time service with the Company.

**“Cliff”** means the initial period during which no shares vest, after which a specified portion vests immediately.

**“Reverse Vesting”** means the mechanism by which the Founder holds legal title to all issued shares but the Company retains the right to repurchase unvested shares upon termination.

**“409A FMV”** means a fair market value established by an independent valuation that qualifies for safe‑harbor treatment under IRC §409A for U.S. grants.

For Spain/EU participants, Good Leaver/Bad Leaver treatment is as set forth in the Spain/EU ESOP Sub‑Plan.
