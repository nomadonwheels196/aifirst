required by New York law.

1) Wage Theft Prevention Act (WTPA) Notice
- At hire, provide written notice of: rate(s) of pay, overtime rate (if non‑exempt), pay day,
  pay basis (hourly/salary), employer name (and any DBAs), address, telephone number, and any
  allowances claimed as part of minimum wage (tips, meals, lodging). Notice provided in
  English and Employee’s primary language where NYDOL offers a template.

2) Sexual Harassment Prevention

  may also apply. Posters and notices will be provided.

3) Paid Sick Leave (NYS + NYC)
- Accrual at least 1 hour per 30 hours worked with annual caps per state (40/56 hours by
  employer size) and NYC (if applicable). Carryover and usage per applicable law.

4) Wage Statements and Pay Frequency
- Wage statements will include all NY‑required fields; pay frequency will meet statutory
  requirements for the Employee’s classification.

5) Salary Transparency (NYC/State)
- For internal/external postings, Company will disclose salary ranges/benefits as required by
  applicable law.

6) Non‑Compete
- Non‑compete covenants are disfavored and will be narrowly tailored if used. Company relies
  primarily on confidentiality, trade secret, and non‑solicitation protections.
