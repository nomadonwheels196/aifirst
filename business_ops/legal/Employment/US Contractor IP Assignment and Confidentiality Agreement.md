## 1. Independent Contractor Status; Consideration
Contractor is an independent contractor and not an employee, agent, or partner of Company.
Contractor shall be solely responsible for taxes, insurance, and benefits. In consideration of

consideration, the parties agree as follows.

## 2. Work Product; Assignment; Work‑Made‑for‑Hire

2.1 Work‑Made‑for‑Hire. To the fullest extent permitted by law, any copyrightable works created
by Contractor in the course of providing services under any SOW ("Work Product") shall be
deemed "works made for hire" for **Ai-First Holdings Ltd., a Cayman Islands exempted company** ("Parent"). To the extent not qualifying as works made for hire for Parent under applicable law, such works shall be deemed works made for hire for Company, which shall immediately assign them to Parent as set forth in Section 2.3.

2.2 Scope of Work Product and IP. "Work Product" means all copyrightable works, and "Intellectual Property" includes all inventions, software, documentation, data, designs, algorithms, mask works, trade secrets, trademarks, and all applications/registrations worldwide, in each case created by Contractor in the course of providing services under any SOW.

2.3 Chain of Title; Direct and Successive Assignment.

(a) **Direct Assignment to Parent**: To the extent any Work Product or Intellectual Property does not qualify as a work made for hire as set forth in Section 2.1, Contractor hereby assigns, transfers, and conveys to **Parent** all right, title, and interest worldwide in and to all Work Product and Intellectual Property, effective immediately upon creation.

(b) **Successive Assignment**: To the extent that Work Product or Intellectual Property is deemed under applicable law to vest initially in Contractor or in Company, Contractor hereby assigns such IP first to Company, and Company, as agent for Parent and by execution of this Agreement through the undersigned authorized officer, hereby simultaneously assigns such IP to Parent.

(c) **Perfection**: Contractor shall execute any additional documents reasonably requested by Company or Parent to perfect Parent's ownership, including direct assignments to Parent for recordation with the USPTO or other IP offices.

(d) **Acknowledgment**: Company represents that it has full authority to effect the successive assignment set forth in subsection (b) pursuant to the Intercompany IP Assignment Agreement between Company and Parent dated [EXECUTED DATE - to be inserted upon intercompany agreement execution].

(e) **No Gap in Chain of Title**: Contractor acknowledges that the purpose of subsections (a) and (b) is to ensure that title to all Work Product and Intellectual Property vests in Parent immediately upon creation, without any gap in chain of title, whether by work-made-for-hire doctrine, direct assignment, or successive assignment through Company as agent.

2.4 Further Assurances. Contractor will promptly disclose Work Product and Intellectual Property and execute documents and take actions reasonably requested to perfect, register, maintain, or enforce Parent's or Company's rights. If Contractor is unavailable, Contractor designates Company as attorney‑in‑fact for such limited purposes.

2.5 Pre‑Existing Materials. Contractor retains ownership of pre‑existing materials identified on
Exhibit A. Contractor grants Company a perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide, royalty‑free
license (with rights to sublicense) to use, reproduce, modify, distribute, and create
derivatives of such pre‑existing materials solely as incorporated into the Work Product.

## 3. Warranties; Non‑Infringement
Contractor represents and warrants that: (i) Work Product is original to Contractor or
Contractor has sufficient rights to assign it; (ii) Work Product does not knowingly infringe
any third‑party rights; and (iii) Contractor will not use third‑party confidential information
without authorization.

## 4. Confidentiality; Security; Return
Contractor will keep Company Confidential Information strictly confidential; use it only for
performing services; follow reasonable security measures; and upon termination, return or
destroy all such materials and certify completion.

## 5. Indemnity (IP)
Contractor will defend and indemnify Company against third‑party claims that Work Product
knowingly infringes intellectual property rights, subject to prompt notice and reasonable
cooperation. Company may participate with its own counsel at its expense.

## 6. Remedies; Governing Law
Breach may cause irreparable harm; Company may seek injunctive relief. This Agreement is
governed by Delaware law; venue lies in state or federal courts in Delaware.

## 7. Miscellaneous

entire agreement on the subject and may be amended only in a signed writing. Any SOW is
incorporated by reference.
