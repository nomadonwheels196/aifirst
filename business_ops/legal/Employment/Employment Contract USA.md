“This Agreement does not require assignment of any invention that qualifies fully under the
provisions of Section 2870 of the California Labor Code. Section 2870 provides that any
provision in an employment agreement which provides that an employee shall assign, or offer
to assign, any of his or her rights in an invention to his or her employer shall not apply
to an invention that the employee developed entirely on his or her own time without using the
employer’s equipment, supplies, facilities, or trade secret information except for those
inventions that either (1) relate at the time of conception or reduction to practice of the
invention to the employer’s business, or actual or demonstrably anticipated research or
development of the employer; or (2) result from any work performed by the employee for the
employer.” The Company will provide any additional statutory notices required by the state of
the Employee’s principal work location.
