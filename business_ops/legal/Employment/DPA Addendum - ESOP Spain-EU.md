Created by: Travis Sheppard
Category: Privacy & Compliance
Status: Short Addendum (GDPR/LOPDGDD)

## Parties and Roles
- Data Exporter (Controller): Ai‑First Spain, S.L.
- Data Importer: Ai‑First Holdings Ltd. (Cayman). For ESOP administration, the Importer
  acts as an independent Controller with respect to equity administration records.

## Scope and Purpose
- Processing of employee/participant data strictly for ESOP administration: grant details,
  vesting, exercises, tax forms, identifiers, contact and employment data necessary to
  operate the plan and comply with legal obligations.

## Lawful Basis
- EU/Spain: Art. 6(1)(b) (contract) and 6(1)(c) (legal obligation) GDPR; where applicable,
  Art. 6(1)(f) (legitimate interests) for internal administration and consolidated reporting.

## International Transfers (Cayman)
- Transfers rely on the European Commission Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs), Module 1
  (Controller→Controller), per Decision (EU) 2021/914. The Parties incorporate the SCCs by
  reference. Annex I/II details are as set out in this Addendum and the ESOP records; the
  Data Importer undertakes appropriate technical and organizational measures (TOMs).

## Supplementary Measures
- Encryption in transit and at rest; role‑based access; least privilege; audit logging.
- Data minimization/pseudonymization where feasible; restricted exports; access from EU only
  unless strictly necessary for plan events.

## Data Subject Rights and Requests
- The Parties cooperate to respond to access, rectification, erasure, restriction, and
  portability requests; Exporter serves as primary contact for Spanish participants.

## Security and Breach Notification
- Importer maintains TOMs appropriate to risk (Art. 32 GDPR) and notifies Exporter without
  undue delay of any personal data breach affecting ESOP participant data (Arts. 33–34 GDPR).

## Sub‑processors/Third‑party Providers
- If Importer engages service providers for ESOP administration (e.g., equity platforms), it
  shall ensure appropriate data transfer mechanisms and written terms consistent with the
  SCCs and this Addendum.

## Data Retention
- Retain only as long as necessary for ESOP administration, statutory obligations, and
  defense of claims; then securely delete or anonymize.

## Contact and Supervision
- Primary supervisory authority: AEPD (Spain). Contact details for privacy inquiries are
  maintained in Company policies provided to participants.
