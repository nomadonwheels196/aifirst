## 2. Consents; Reserved Matters
On matters designated as "Reserved Matters" in the applicable shareholders/voting agreement, Investor shall not vote (or cause to be voted) the Shares in a manner that would remove or diminish the Chair’s casting vote, the Founder director seat, or the Class B protective provisions without the prior written consent of the Founder holders of a majority of Class B shares.

  statement), and within ninety (90) days after fiscal year‑end, audited annual financials;
- (b) Provide Investor with at least ten (10) Business Days' advance written notice of any
  meeting or written consent at which Reserved Matters will be considered, together with the
  materials to be considered;
