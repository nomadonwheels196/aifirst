**Service Fee = Total Costs × (1 + Mark-Up)**

Where Mark-Up is:

(a) **Seven percent (7%)** for Category A Services (R&D and Product Development)

- Functional and risk analysis documenting functions performed, assets used, and risks assumed
- OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines for intra-group services (Chapter VII)
- Cost Plus Method as the most appropriate transfer pricing methodology

The parties acknowledge that these rates fall within the arm's-length range of 5-10% identified in the Ai-First Group Transfer Pricing Policy dated October 17, 2025.

**3.3 Cost Allocation Methodology**

(a) **Direct Costs**: Allocated based on actual time tracking, expense reports, and documented usage for each Service category;

(c) The allocation methodology shall be documented, applied consistently, and reviewed annually for reasonableness.

   - Mark-Up calculation
   - Total Service Fee due

(b) Service Recipient shall pay each invoice within thirty (30) days of receipt;

(c) Payments shall be made in the currency specified in the invoice (USD for US Service Provider, EUR for EU Service Provider) via wire transfer to the account designated by each Service Provider;

(d) Late payments shall bear interest at eight percent (8%) per annum or the maximum rate permitted by law, whichever is lower.

**3.5 Annual True-Up**

Within ninety (90) days following the end of each Fiscal Year, the Service Providers shall provide Service Recipient with a reconciliation report showing:
- Actual Total Costs incurred during the Fiscal Year
- Total Service Fees paid during the Fiscal Year
- Any adjustment required to ensure accurate cost recovery plus Mark-Up

Any adjustment (overpayment or underpayment) shall be settled within thirty (30) days of agreement on the reconciliation.

**3.6 Withholding Taxes and Compliance**

(a) Withholding Schedule (Service Fees):

| Payment Flow | Statutory WHT Rate | Treaty Rate | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Ai‑First Holdings (Cayman) → Ai‑First Inc. (USA) | 0% (Cayman) | N/A | Cayman does not levy WHT on outbound service fees |
| Ai‑First Holdings (Cayman) → Ai‑First Spain, S.L. | 0% (Cayman) | N/A | Cayman does not levy WHT on outbound service fees |

(b) Compliance Process:

1) Calculation: Service Recipient (Cayman) calculates any applicable WHT (currently 0%) at time of invoice approval.  
2) Remittance: If WHT becomes applicable by law change, Service Recipient remits by the required deadline and provides withholding certificates to Service Providers.  
3) Documentation: Parties retain evidence of any WHT analysis and remittances in their tax files for at least ten (10) years.

**Prepared by:** Travis Sheppard (via Claude Code)
**Date:** November 2, 2025
**Status:** Draft for Legal & Tax Counsel Review

**IMPORTANT NOTES FOR COUNSEL:**

1. **Transfer Pricing Benchmarking**: Before execution, obtain a benchmarking study supporting the 7% (R&D/Operations) and 5% (Management) mark-ups using Cost Plus Method. Ensure comparables are from appropriate databases (Compustat, Orbis, Amadeus).

2. **IRC §482 Compliance**: Prepare contemporaneous documentation for U.S. tax purposes, including functional analysis and benchmarking study, before U.S. tax return due date.

3. **Spanish Modelo 232**: EU Service Provider must file annual Modelo 232 with AEAT reporting related-party transactions, including services provided to Cayman Holdings.

4. **Cayman Economic Substance**: Service Recipient (Cayman Holdings) must demonstrate adequate substance in Cayman to justify receiving and paying for Services. Document board meetings, decision-making authority, and Cayman-based personnel/service providers.

5. **Withholding Taxes**: See Section 3.6 (Withholding Taxes and Compliance). Cayman currently
   levies 0% WHT on outbound service fees; review annually. Confirm any inbound WHT obligations
   if laws change, and obtain/retain residency certificates and filings as needed.

6. **Service Benefit Test**: Ensure Services pass the "service benefit test" under OECD Guidelines (Chapter VII) - i.e., services provide value to Service Recipient and Service Recipient would be willing to pay an unrelated party for such services.

7. **Shareholder Activities**: Ensure Services do not include "shareholder activities" (stewardship, corporate governance duties for which parent should not charge subsidiaries) per OECD Guidelines.

8. **GDPR Data Processing Agreement**: Execute a separate DPA under GDPR Article 28 for personal data processing by Service Providers on behalf of Service Recipient.

9. **Cost Allocation**: Document and maintain consistent cost allocation methodologies. Indirect costs must be allocated using reasonable keys (headcount, usage, revenue) and applied consistently.

10. **Annual True-Up**: Implement process for annual reconciliation to ensure costs are accurate and mark-ups are properly calculated. Avoid under/over-recovery of costs.
