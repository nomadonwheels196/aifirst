# Legal Review – Ai-First (Batch 4: Employment Contracts)
**Date**: 2025-11-02 11:39
**Scope**: Employment contracts for Spain and USA operations
**Jurisdictions**: USA (Federal/Delaware), Spain/EU

## Executive Summary
Both employment contracts contain **critical IP assignment defects** that fail to effectively transfer ownership to the Cayman holding company, creating fragmented IP ownership across entities. The USA contract includes **unenforceable non-compete provisions** without supporting consideration in at-will employment context and lacks state-specific compliance for remote workers. The Spain contract has **inadequate GDPR compliance**, missing mandatory Article 13 disclosures, and the moral rights waiver may be partially unenforceable under Spanish law. Both contracts require material revision before use to protect corporate IP ownership and avoid employment law violations.

## Critical Issues

### C1. Defective IP Assignment Chain to Cayman Holdings
- **Files**:
  - `Employment Contract Spain 29dfd07ed1c281b7ac64e0201cca6fd1.md:115-133`
  - `Employment Contract USA 29dfd07ed1c281c082edf4d329db8a29.md:67-70`
- **Current Text (Spain)**: "The Employee agrees to maintain confidentiality regarding all proprietary information and to assign to the Employer any intellectual property or inventions created during the course of employment... For clarity, all intellectual property created in connection with Group business is assigned to Ai‑First Holdings Ltd. (Cayman) and licensed to Ai‑First Spain, S.L. under intercompany agreements; the Employee agrees to execute any documents necessary to effect such assignment/licensing."
- **Current Text (USA)**: "The Employee assigns to the Company all rights, title, and interest in any inventions, discoveries, or works created during employment that relate to the Company's business or use its resources."
- **Legal Problem**: The assignment structure is legally defective in both contracts. Under IP law across all three jurisdictions, an employee can only assign IP rights to their direct employer. The Spain contract purports to have the employee assign IP directly to a non-employer third party (Cayman Holdings), which creates an invalid assignment chain. The USA contract assigns only to Ai First Inc., leaving IP stranded in the subsidiary with no automatic upstream transfer. This violates fundamental principles of privity of contract and creates fragmented IP ownership that could be challenged by employees, investors, or acquirers. In Spain, Article 15-17 of the Patent Law (Ley 24/2015) governs employee inventions and requires the employer to be the initial assignee. In the USA, assignment requires valid consideration to the actual contracting party.
- **Potential Consequences**: IP created by employees remains legally owned by the local subsidiaries (Spain S.L. or USA Inc.), not by Cayman Holdings. This defeats the intended holding company structure and creates massive due diligence problems for investors or acquirers. Employees could later challenge IP ownership claims by Cayman Holdings. The "agrees to execute any documents" language is insufficient to cure the defective initial assignment. **Founders face personal liability if they represent to investors that IP is owned by Cayman Holdings when the employment contracts fail to effect that transfer.**
- **Recommended Fix**:
  1. **Spain Contract**: Revise Section 7 to: "The Employee hereby assigns to Ai‑First Spain, S.L. all rights, title, and interest in any intellectual property, inventions, works, designs, data, know-how, and software (collectively, 'IP Rights') created, conceived, or reduced to practice during employment that relate to the Company's business or use Company resources. Employee acknowledges that Ai‑First Spain, S.L. has entered into an IP Assignment and License Agreement with Ai‑First Holdings Ltd. (Cayman) dated [Date] under which all such IP Rights are automatically assigned onward to Ai‑First Holdings Ltd. Employee agrees to execute any additional documents reasonably requested to perfect such assignments."
  2. **USA Contract**: Revise Section 7.2 to: "The Employee hereby assigns to Ai First Inc. all rights, title, and interest in any inventions, discoveries, works, and intellectual property created during employment that relate to the Company's business or use its resources. Employee acknowledges that Ai First Inc. has entered into an IP Assignment Agreement with Ai‑First Holdings Ltd. (Cayman) dated [Date] under which all such IP is automatically assigned to the parent company. Employee agrees to execute any documents reasonably necessary to perfect such assignments, including direct assignments to Ai‑First Holdings Ltd. if requested."
  3. **Critical**: Ensure intercompany IP assignment agreements between each subsidiary and Cayman Holdings are actually executed and dated before any employee contract becomes effective.
- **Jurisdictional Impact**: USA, Cayman Islands, Spain/EU – affects all entities and cross-border IP ownership

### C2. Spanish Moral Rights Waiver Unenforceable
- **File**: `Employment Contract Spain 29dfd07ed1c281b7ac64e0201cca6fd1.md:129-133`
- **Current Text**: "To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the Employee waives the exercise of moral rights (including rights of attribution and integrity) and grants the Employer and Ai‑First Holdings Ltd. (Cayman) an irrevocable, worldwide, royalty‑free license to adapt, modify, translate, and reproduce such works..."
- **Legal Problem**: Under Spanish copyright law (Real Decreto Legislativo 1/1996, Ley de Propiedad Intelectual, Articles 14-16), moral rights (derechos morales) are largely inalienable and cannot be waived in advance by contract, particularly the rights of paternity (attribution) and integrity. Article 14 provides that moral rights are inherent to the author and cannot be waived except in very limited circumstances after the work is created. The blanket waiver language is unenforceable and creates false expectations about the Company's rights. While economic rights can be assigned, moral rights remain with the creator. This is a fundamental difference between continental European (droit d'auteur) and Anglo-American copyright traditions.
- **Potential Consequences**: The Company believes it has obtained a full waiver of moral rights but has not. Spanish employees could later assert moral rights claims to demand attribution, object to modifications that harm their honor or reputation, or withdraw works from circulation. This creates particular risk for AI-generated derivative works where the employee's original contribution is heavily modified. Any attempt to enforce the waiver clause would fail in Spanish courts. **If the Company licenses or sells IP to third parties representing that moral rights have been waived, founders could face personal liability for misrepresentation.**
- **Recommended Fix**: Replace the moral rights waiver language with: "Employee acknowledges that moral rights under Spanish law cannot be waived in advance by contract. To the extent permitted by law, Employee agrees not to assert moral rights in a manner that would interfere with the Company's or Ai‑First Holdings Ltd.'s business use of the works. Employee agrees to execute specific post-creation waivers or consents to modifications when requested for legitimate business purposes. Employee grants the Company and Ai‑First Holdings Ltd. an irrevocable, worldwide, royalty-free license to use, adapt, modify, translate, and create derivative works from all copyrightable works created during employment, and agrees to reasonably cooperate to minimize any moral rights conflicts." Add a separate provision requiring post-creation written consents for significant modifications.
- **Jurisdictional Impact**: Spain/EU – violates Spanish Ley de Propiedad Intelectual mandatory provisions

### C3. USA Non-Compete Unenforceable Without Adequate Consideration
- **File**: `Employment Contract USA 29dfd07ed1c281c082edf4d329db8a29.md:73-81`
- **Current Text**: "During employment and for a period of 12 months after termination, the Employee shall not directly compete with the Company or engage in business that materially conflicts with its operations, except where prohibited by law."
- **Legal Problem**: Under Delaware law and most U.S. jurisdictions, a non-compete covenant entered into at the commencement of at-will employment requires independent consideration beyond the mere offer of employment to be enforceable. Delaware courts apply a reasonableness test (Tristate Courier & Carriage, Inc. v. Berryman) and increasingly scrutinize non-competes lacking clear consideration. The "at-will" employment designation in Section 3 combined with the non-compete in Section 8 creates a direct enforceability problem: if the employee can be fired without cause at any time, the promised employment is illusory consideration. Additionally, many states where remote employees may be located (California, Oklahoma, North Dakota, DC) have statutes that void or severely restrict non-compete agreements. The generic "except where prohibited by law" savings clause is insufficient to address state-specific restrictions. Finally, the FTC's proposed rule on non-compete clauses (if finalized) would ban most non-competes for workers.
- **Potential Consequences**: The non-compete is likely unenforceable against most employees. If the Company attempts to enforce it and loses, it may be liable for the employee's attorney fees and damages. More critically, **if Travis Sheppard or other officers certify to investors or acquirers that key employees are bound by enforceable non-competes when they are not, this creates potential securities fraud or misrepresentation liability.** The Company cannot rely on this provision to protect confidential information or prevent competition. For remote workers in California or other restrictive states, the entire provision is void, and attempting to enforce it could trigger California Business & Professions Code § 16600 violations and penalties.
- **Recommended Fix**:
  1. Add to Section 8.1: "In consideration for the covenants in this Section 8, the Company agrees to pay Employee a non-compete consideration payment of $[amount, e.g., $1,000 or 10% of annual salary] payable [upon execution / upon termination if non-compete applies]." This provides independent consideration.
  2. Add state-specific carve-outs: "This Section 8.1 shall be void and unenforceable if Employee's principal place of work is in California, Oklahoma, North Dakota, or any other jurisdiction that prohibits non-compete agreements by statute. In such jurisdictions, the Company shall rely solely on the non-solicitation, confidentiality, and IP assignment provisions."
  3. Narrow the geographic and scope restrictions: Replace "directly compete" with "serve in a substantially similar role for a direct competitor listed in Schedule A" to meet reasonableness requirements.
  4. Add blue-pencil savings language: "If any provision of this Section 8 is found to be unenforceable, the parties agree that a court may modify the provision to the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable under applicable law."
- **Jurisdictional Impact**: USA (all states) – particularly unenforceable in CA, OK, ND, DC; questionable in DE without additional consideration

## High-Risk Issues

### H1. Spain Contract Missing Mandatory GDPR Article 13 Disclosures
- **File**: `Employment Contract Spain 29dfd07ed1c281b7ac64e0201cca6fd1.md:137-149`
- **Current Text**: "The Employer will process personal data of the Employee in accordance with applicable Spanish and EU data protection laws (GDPR). The Employee may exercise their rights of access, rectification, and deletion as provided by law."
- **Legal Problem**: GDPR Article 13 requires specific mandatory disclosures at the time of data collection (at contract signing), including: (a) identity and contact details of the controller and DPO if applicable; (b) purposes and legal basis for processing; (c) legitimate interests if relied upon; (d) recipients or categories of recipients; (e) intention to transfer data outside EU and safeguards; (f) retention period or criteria; (g) full list of data subject rights (not just access, rectification, deletion, but also restriction, portability, objection, and right to withdraw consent and lodge complaints); (h) whether provision of data is statutory/contractual requirement and consequences of not providing it; (i) information about automated decision-making if any. The current Section 8 fails to provide nearly all of these mandatory disclosures. This is a per-employee violation under GDPR Article 83(5)(b), subject to fines up to €20 million or 4% of global annual turnover.
- **Potential Consequences**: Spanish Data Protection Agency (AEPD) can impose administrative fines for each non-compliant employment contract. Employees can file complaints triggering AEPD investigations. In litigation, employees could claim the data processing was unlawful from the start, potentially invalidating HR records and creating wrongful termination defenses. **Company officers (including Travis Sheppard) can be held personally liable under certain circumstances for GDPR violations, particularly if they approved non-compliant contracts knowing they lacked required disclosures.**
- **Recommended Fix**: Replace Section 8 with comprehensive GDPR-compliant privacy notice: "**Data Protection Notice (GDPR Article 13):** Ai‑First Spain, S.L. (CIF [X], [address]) is the data controller for your personal data. Contact our Data Protection Officer at [email]. We process your data for: (i) performance of this employment contract (legal basis: GDPR Art. 6(1)(b)); (ii) compliance with legal obligations including tax, social security, and labor law (legal basis: GDPR Art. 6(1)(c)); (iii) legitimate business interests including security, communication, and Group reporting (legal basis: GDPR Art. 6(1)(f)). Your data may be shared with: payroll providers, benefits administrators, Group companies (including Ai‑First Holdings Ltd. in Cayman Islands under Standard Contractual Clauses), government authorities as required by law, and professional advisors under confidentiality obligations. We retain your data during employment and for [X years] thereafter to comply with legal obligations. You have the right to access, rectify, erase, restrict processing, data portability, object to processing, withdraw consent where applicable, and lodge a complaint with the Spanish Data Protection Agency (www.aepd.es). Providing personal data is a contractual requirement; failure to provide required information may prevent us from entering into or performing the employment contract."
- **Jurisdictional Impact**: Spain/EU – violates GDPR mandatory disclosure requirements

### H2. USA Contract Lacks State-Specific Employment Law Compliance
- **File**: `Employment Contract USA 29dfd07ed1c281c082edf4d329db8a29.md:1-129`
- **Legal Problem**: The contract is drafted as a generic Delaware-law agreement but fails to address state-specific employment requirements that apply based on where the employee actually performs work. For remote employees, the employment laws of their work location generally apply, not Delaware law (which has minimal employee-protective statutes). Critical gaps include: (a) California requires specific wage statement disclosures, sick leave accrual details, and limitations on arbitration/forum selection; (b) New York requires detailed notice of pay rates, overtime exemption basis, and sexual harassment prevention training; (c) Colorado requires job posting transparency and anti-retaliation protections; (d) multiple states have mandatory pay frequency requirements different from "normal payroll schedule"; (e) paid sick leave mandates exist in 15+ states/cities with specific accrual and carryover rules; (f) the unlimited venue provision (Section 11) may be unenforceable for employees in states requiring local venue for employment disputes.
- **Potential Consequences**: The Company could face state labor law violations, wage-and-hour claims, penalties for non-compliant wage statements, and wrongful termination liability. State attorneys general or labor departments can investigate and impose civil penalties. The Delaware choice-of-law and forum selection clauses may be declared unenforceable, forcing litigation in employee-favorable jurisdictions. **If Travis Sheppard or HR personnel fail to comply with state-specific mandates after being put on notice, they could face personal penalties in states like California (Labor Code § 226 provides $50-$4,000 per violation for wage statement failures).**
- **Recommended Fix**: Add to Section 3: "For employees who primarily work remotely, the employment laws of the state where Employee performs the majority of work shall apply to the extent they provide greater protections than Delaware law or are mandatory and cannot be waived by choice-of-law provisions. The Company shall provide any notices, wage statements, or other documentation required by the state of Employee's principal work location." Add to Section 6: "Paid sick leave shall accrue and be available in accordance with the requirements of the state/city where Employee works, if such requirements provide greater benefits than this Agreement." Revise Section 11 to: "This Agreement shall be governed by Delaware law, except that the employment laws (including wage-hour, leave, discrimination, and termination protections) of the state where Employee principally performs work shall apply to the extent they are mandatory or provide greater employee protections. For employees working primarily in [list restrictive states like CA, NY, etc.], disputes shall be resolved in the courts of Employee's principal work location."
- **Jurisdictional Impact**: USA (multi-state) – affects all remote employees; particularly critical for CA, NY, CO, WA, OR

### H3. Spain Probation Period Exceeds Statutory Maximum
- **File**: `Employment Contract Spain 29dfd07ed1c281b7ac64e0201cca6fd1.md:39-52`
- **Current Text**: "A probationary period of [X months] shall apply, in accordance with the Spanish Workers' Statute (Estatuto de los Trabajadores)."
- **Legal Problem**: Article 14 of the Estatuto de los Trabajadores (Royal Legislative Decree 2/2015) strictly limits probationary periods based on the employee's job level and contract type: (a) for técnicos titulados (university-degree holders), maximum 6 months; (b) for other employees in companies with >25 employees, maximum 2 months; (c) for employees in companies with ≤25 employees, maximum 3 months. The placeholder "[X months]" creates a risk that someone will insert a longer period (e.g., 12 months common in USA contracts), making that provision void. Additionally, the probation period must be agreed in writing before the employment relationship begins or it defaults to the collective bargaining agreement minimum, which may be shorter. Spanish courts strictly enforce these limits, and any excess probation period is void ab initio.
- **Potential Consequences**: If a probation period exceeding the statutory maximum is used, the entire probation clause becomes void, and the employee is treated as a permanent employee from day one. The Company loses the ability to terminate without severance during the intended probation period. If the Company terminates believing it's within probation when the provision is void, the employee can claim wrongful termination (despido improcedente) and demand severance of 33 days per year worked or reinstatement. This creates immediate financial liability and labor court litigation risk.
- **Recommended Fix**: Replace placeholder with compliant language: "A probationary period of [**2 months for non-graduate employees / 6 months for técnicos titulados (university-degree holders)**] shall apply, in accordance with Article 14 of the Estatuto de los Trabajadores. [If applicable collective bargaining agreement specifies a shorter period, that shorter period shall control.]" Include internal HR process note: "Before finalizing each contract, verify: (1) employee's education level; (2) company size at time of hire; (3) applicable collective bargaining agreement (convenio colectivo) for the sector/province; (4) insert the correct maximum probation period."
- **Jurisdictional Impact**: Spain – violates mandatory provisions of Estatuto de los Trabajadores Article 14

### H4. IP Assignment Missing Pre-Invention Disclosure Requirement
- **File**: `Employment Contract USA 29dfd07ed1c281c082edf4d329db8a29.md:67-70`
- **Legal Problem**: Many U.S. states (including California, Delaware, Illinois, Kansas, Minnesota, North Carolina, Washington) have enacted statutes protecting employee inventions created entirely on the employee's own time without using employer resources. California Labor Code § 2870-2872 is the most well-known and provides that employment agreements cannot require assignment of inventions developed entirely on the employee's own time without company equipment/resources and that do not relate to the company's business or R&D. To comply with these statutes and avoid later disputes, employers must: (a) include statutory notice language informing employees of their rights; (b) require employees to disclose any pre-existing inventions or IP they want to exclude from the assignment ("Prior Inventions"); (c) provide a mechanism for employees to identify post-employment inventions that fall outside the assignment. The current Section 7.2 contains none of these required elements and could be found overly broad and unenforceable in California and similar states.
- **Potential Consequences**: In states with employee invention protection statutes, the IP assignment provision may be declared unenforceable or limited in scope. Employees could later claim that specific inventions fall outside the assignment, creating IP ownership disputes at critical times (e.g., during fundraising or M&A due diligence). California employees could file Labor Commissioner complaints for unlawful contract provisions. **If founders represent to investors that all employee-created IP is owned by the Company, but the contracts are legally insufficient to accomplish that transfer, founders face personal misrepresentation liability.**
- **Recommended Fix**: Revise Section 7.2 to: "**7.2 Inventions and IP Assignment.** (a) **Prior Inventions.** Employee has listed on Exhibit A all inventions, discoveries, and proprietary information existing prior to employment that Employee wishes to exclude from this Agreement ('Prior Inventions'). If no Exhibit A is attached, Employee represents that there are no Prior Inventions. (b) **Assignment.** Employee assigns to Ai First Inc. all rights, title, and interest in any inventions, discoveries, works, and intellectual property created during employment that (i) relate to the Company's business or actual/demonstrably anticipated research; (ii) result from work performed for the Company; or (iii) are developed using Company equipment, supplies, facilities, or trade secrets. (c) **Exception for Certain Inventions.** This Section 7.2 does not apply to inventions developed entirely on Employee's own time without using Company resources, that do not relate to Company's business or R&D, and that do not result from Company work, as provided by [state] law. (d) **Notice.** Employee acknowledges receiving notice of rights under [California Labor Code § 2870 / equivalent state statute]. [Attach full statutory notice as required by applicable state law.]" Add Exhibit A template for Prior Inventions disclosure.
- **Jurisdictional Impact**: USA (CA, DE, IL, KS, MN, NC, WA, UT) – required for compliance with state employee invention protection statutes

### H5. Spain Contract Fails to Specify Required Minimum Wage Compliance
- **File**: `Employment Contract Spain 29dfd07ed1c281b7ac64e0201cca6fd1.md:71-83`
- **Current Text**: "The Employee shall receive a gross annual salary of [€ amount], payable in [12 / 14] installments, subject to statutory deductions and withholdings."
- **Legal Problem**: Spanish law requires that all employment contracts comply with: (a) the national minimum wage (Salario Mínimo Interprofesional or SMI), adjusted annually by the government (2025: €15,876 gross annual for full-time work); (b) the salary minimums established by the applicable collective bargaining agreement (convenio colectivo) for the sector and province, which typically sets minimums by job category/professional level that exceed the SMI; (c) 14-payment structure (12 monthly + 2 extraordinary payments in summer and December) or equivalent 12-payment gross-up. The contract does not reference the applicable convenio colectivo or confirm which professional category/salary grade applies, creating risk that the agreed salary falls below the legal minimum. Additionally, failure to specify which convenio applies makes it unclear what other terms (e.g., working hours, specific leave entitlements, salary supplements) are mandatory.
- **Potential Consequences**: If the agreed salary is below the applicable convenio minimum, the employee can claim the difference in back pay through labor courts (Juzgado de lo Social), plus interest and potential penalties. The Spanish labor inspectorate (Inspección de Trabajo) can audit payroll and impose fines for paying below legal minimums (€3,126-€10,000 per employee per violation, or higher for repeat violations). The Company could face collective claims if multiple employees are underpaid. Additionally, if the contract fails to specify the correct professional category, disputes can arise about job duties, promotion paths, and severance calculations (which are based on salary).
- **Recommended Fix**: Revise Section 5 to: "The Employee shall receive a gross annual salary of **€[amount]**, payable in **[14] installments** (12 monthly payments plus two extraordinary payments in [June/July and December], in accordance with the applicable collective bargaining agreement). This salary meets or exceeds the national minimum wage (SMI) and the minimum salary for the Employee's professional category under the [**name of applicable convenio colectivo, e.g., 'Convenio Colectivo Estatal de Empresas de Consultoría'**] applicable in [**province**]. The Employee is classified as [**specific professional category per convenio, e.g., 'Grupo Profesional 2, Técnico'**]. [Alternative for 12-payment structure: "payable in **12** monthly installments that include proportional extraordinary payments (prorrata de pagas extras)."]" Add internal HR note: "Before finalizing each contract, determine: (1) applicable convenio based on company CNAE code and employee job duties; (2) correct professional group/category under that convenio; (3) minimum salary for that category; (4) ensure offered salary ≥ convenio minimum."
- **Jurisdictional Impact**: Spain – required for compliance with Estatuto de los Trabajadores and sector-specific collective bargaining agreements

## Jurisdictional Notes

### USA (Federal/Delaware)
- IP assignments require valid consideration to contracting party; cannot assign to non-party without separate agreement (property law, contract privity doctrine)
- At-will employment provides illusory consideration for restrictive covenants absent additional compensation (Tristate Courier v. Berryman, DE case law)
- Employee invention protection statutes in CA (Lab. Code § 2870), DE (19 Del.C. § 805), and 6+ other states require statutory notice and Prior Inventions disclosure
- Federal FLSA requires proper exempt/non-exempt classification; misclassification creates joint and several liability for officers
- State-specific employment laws apply based on work location regardless of choice-of-law clause if more protective or mandatory

### Spain/EU
- Moral rights (derechos morales) under Ley de Propiedad Intelectual Arts. 14-16 are inalienable and cannot be prospectively waived in employment contracts
- GDPR Article 13 requires extensive mandatory disclosures at data collection; violations subject to fines up to €20M or 4% global turnover (Art. 83(5))
- Estatuto de los Trabajadores Art. 14 strictly limits probation periods: 6 months for university graduates, 2-3 months for others; excess is void ab initio
- Collective bargaining agreements (convenios colectivos) set mandatory minimums for salary, working conditions, and professional categories by sector/province
- Spanish Patent Law Arts. 15-17 governs employee inventions; initial assignment must be to employer, not third party

### Cayman Islands
- As non-employer entity, Cayman Holdings cannot receive direct IP assignment from employees of subsidiaries; requires two-step assignment or acknowledgment structure
- Intercompany IP agreements between subsidiaries and Holdings must be formally executed and dated to establish chain of title
