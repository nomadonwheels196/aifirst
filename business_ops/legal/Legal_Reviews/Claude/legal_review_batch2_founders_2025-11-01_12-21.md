# Legal Review – Ai-First (BATCH 2: Founder Documents)
**Date**: 2025-11-01 12:21
**Scope**: Founder Agreement and Founder Stock Purchase Agreement
**Jurisdictions**: USA (Federal/Delaware), Cayman Islands, Spain/EU

## Executive Summary
The founder documents contain **critical structural inconsistencies** between vesting schedules, **no 83(b) election guidance** creating substantial US tax risk, **incomplete IP assignment** (relying on external agreement), **conflicting governing law provisions** that undermine enforceability, and **missing Delaware C-Corp documentation** for the US subsidiary critical to Travis Sheppard's operations. The documents expose founders to personal tax liability and create IP ownership ambiguity during the pre-incorporation period.

## CRITICAL ISSUES

### CRIT-1: Vesting Schedule Contradiction Creates Enforceability Risk
- **Files**: `Founder Agreement 29dfd07ed1c28067a9c4e1e558a67b78.md:Section 3.2` AND `Founder Stock Purchase Agreement 29dfd07ed1c2811499fdfdfb72a14b96.md:line 15`
- **Current Text**:
  - Founder Agreement: "3-year vesting schedule with a 1-year cliff, vesting quarterly thereafter"
  - Stock Purchase Agreement: "25% after one year; remainder monthly over the next 36 months"
- **Legal Problem**: These are **materially different vesting schedules**. The Founder Agreement describes 3 years total (25% at cliff, then quarterly over remaining 2 years). The Stock Purchase Agreement describes 4 years total (25% at one year, monthly over 36 additional months = 48 months total). Under Cayman law and common law contract principles, when integrated agreements conflict, courts must determine intent or may find ambiguity rendering the provision unenforceable. This creates uncertainty about actual vesting rights and repurchase obligations.
- **Potential Consequences**: Dispute over actual vesting schedule if founder departs; company repurchase rights unclear; potential challenge to equity structure in M&A due diligence; possible claims of fraudulent inducement if founder relied on one schedule over another.
- **Recommended Fix**: **Standardize on 4-year vesting with 1-year cliff**: Both documents must state: "The Shares shall vest over a four (4) year period, with twenty-five percent (25%) vesting on the first anniversary of the Vesting Commencement Date (the 'Cliff'), and the remaining seventy-five percent (75%) vesting in equal monthly installments over the subsequent thirty-six (36) months, subject to the Founder's continued service to the Company." Insert explicit integration clause: "In the event of any conflict between this Agreement and the Founder Stock Purchase Agreement, the vesting schedule set forth herein shall control."

### CRIT-2: No 83(b) Election Guidance – Substantial US Tax Trap
- **Files**: Both documents (omission issue)
- **Current Text**: No mention of IRC Section 83(b) election requirements or deadlines
- **Legal Problem**: Under IRC Section 83, when a founder receives stock subject to vesting (substantial risk of forfeiture), the founder is taxed on the spread between FMV and purchase price **at each vesting event**, not at issuance. Given the $0.0001 purchase price and likely higher FMV at future vesting dates, this creates ordinary income tax liability at vesting. An 83(b) election within 30 days of issuance allows taxation at issuance (minimal tax on minimal spread), avoiding future ordinary income. **Failure to file 83(b) within 30 days is irrevocable and creates catastrophic tax consequences**. For Travis Sheppard (US person), this is **mandatory tax planning**. For Miguel Romera (Spanish tax resident), Spanish tax treatment of stock options/restricted stock may also require planning, though Spain doesn't have direct 83(b) equivalent.
- **Potential Consequences**: Without 83(b) election, Travis faces ordinary income tax on full FMV of vested shares (potentially hundreds of thousands of dollars) at each vesting event with no cash to pay tax (illiquid stock). This is a **classic founder tax trap**. IRS may also impose penalties. Spanish tax implications for Miguel need separate analysis but could include taxation at vesting under income tax rules.
- **Recommended Fix**: Add Section 3.5 to Founder Agreement: **"83(b) Election (US Founders). Any Founder who is a US person for tax purposes acknowledges that the Shares are subject to substantial risk of forfeiture and hereby agrees to timely file an election under Section 83(b) of the US Internal Revenue Code within thirty (30) days of the date of this Agreement. The Founder acknowledges that failure to file such election will result in ordinary income recognition at each vesting date based on the then-current fair market value of the Shares. The Company shall provide the Founder with the necessary information to complete the 83(b) election but the Founder bears sole responsibility for timely filing with the IRS and providing copies to the Company. The Founder is strongly advised to consult with a tax advisor regarding this election."** Add to Stock Purchase Agreement: **"IMPORTANT TAX NOTICE: If you are a US taxpayer, you should consult with a tax advisor immediately regarding the advisability of filing an election under Section 83(b) of the Internal Revenue Code. This election must be filed within 30 days of the purchase date and the deadline is not extendable."**

### CRIT-3: Missing Delaware C-Corp Documentation for Ai-First Inc.
- **Files**: Both documents (structural gap)
- **Current Text**: Documents govern Cayman Islands holding company only (Ai-First Holdings Ltd.)
- **Legal Problem**: Based on repository context, the corporate structure includes a US subsidiary (likely Ai-First Inc., a Delaware C-Corp) where Travis Sheppard will likely be employed and conduct US operations. **There are no corresponding founder equity documents for the US entity**. Under typical holding company structures, founders may need equity in both Holdco (for ultimate ownership) and Opco (for tax efficiency, US investor access, and QSBS eligibility under IRC Section 1202). Without parallel US documents: (1) Travis's employment relationship is unclear, (2) QSBS qualification may be lost (requires C-Corp stock held by founders), (3) US investors may have difficulty investing directly in Cayman entity, (4) potential phantom income issues for Travis if Cayman shares are deemed compensatory but he has no US entity stock.
- **Potential Consequences**: Loss of QSBS tax benefits (0% capital gains on qualified small business stock up to $10M or 10x basis); difficulty raising from US VCs who prefer Delaware structures; employment law ambiguity for Travis (employed by which entity?); potential US tax reporting failures (Forms 5471, 8938 for foreign corporation ownership).
- **Recommended Fix**: **Immediately draft parallel Founder Agreement and Restricted Stock Purchase Agreement for Ai-First Inc. (Delaware C-Corp)**. Ensure Travis receives founder shares in the US entity qualifying for QSBS (issued within 5 years of incorporation, $50M gross asset test, active business requirement). Structure as either: (1) **Dual equity**: Travis holds both Cayman Holdco shares and Delaware Opco shares with mirror vesting, or (2) **Single entity + tax election**: Travis holds only Holdco shares but files 83(b) election and considers IRC Section 1504 consolidated return election if Holdco owns 80%+ of Opco. Coordinate with tax advisor on optimal structure. Ensure Delaware entity has bylaws, board minutes authorizing equity grants, and proper 409A valuation for FMV determination.

## HIGH-RISK ISSUES

### HIGH-1: Incomplete IP Assignment – Reliance on Separate Agreement
- **File**: `Founder Agreement 29dfd07ed1c28067a9c4e1e558a67b78.md:Section 6`
- **Current Text**: "All Founders shall execute the **IP Assignment & Confidentiality Agreement** to formalize this assignment."
- **Legal Problem**: Section 6 declares all IP is Company property but **defers actual assignment to separate agreement**. Under US, Cayman, and Spanish law, IP assignment requires clear, present transfer language with specificity. A mere promise to execute a future agreement may not create enforceable assignment, particularly for patents (which require written assignment under US 35 USC 261) and copyrights (which require writing under US 17 USC 204). If founders created IP **before** executing the separate agreement, ownership may remain with founders personally. This is especially critical for AI/ML algorithms and code created pre-incorporation.
- **Potential Consequences**: Company may not own core IP; founders retain rights to pre-incorporation inventions; investors will require full IP assignment reps/warranties in financing documents, creating closing risk; potential disputes over IP ownership if founder departs before executing separate agreement; Spain's Copyright Act (Royal Legislative Decree 1/1996) provides employee works belong to employer only under employment relationship, not contractor/founder relationship without explicit assignment.
- **Recommended Fix**: Add to Section 6: **"Each Founder hereby irrevocably assigns, transfers, and conveys to the Company all right, title, and interest in and to all Intellectual Property (as defined below) conceived, created, developed, or reduced to practice by such Founder, solely or jointly with others, at any time during the Founder's service to the Company, whether or not during working hours or using Company resources. 'Intellectual Property' means all patents, patent applications, copyrights, trade secrets, trademarks, mask works, inventions, discoveries, improvements, ideas, algorithms, software code, designs, know-how, and any other intellectual property rights worldwide. The Founder agrees to execute all documents and take all actions necessary to perfect the Company's ownership rights, including patent assignments, copyright registrations, and declarations. This assignment is effective immediately upon creation of the Intellectual Property and does not require further action by the Founder, though the Founder agrees to cooperate with documentation requests. For any Intellectual Property created by a Founder prior to the date of this Agreement, the Founder represents that such Intellectual Property is either (i) assigned to the Company pursuant to a separate written agreement, or (ii) excluded from this assignment pursuant to Schedule A hereto."** Add Schedule A for founders to list any excluded prior inventions.

### HIGH-2: Conflicting Governing Law Undermines Enforceability
- **File**: `Founder Agreement 29dfd07ed1c28067a9c4e1e558a67b78.md:Section 11`
- **Current Text**: "This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the **laws of the Cayman Islands**, with respect to Company matters, and the **laws of Spain** for matters concerning Founder obligations as residents."
- **Legal Problem**: **Dual governing law provisions create interpretation chaos**. Courts will not apply two different legal systems to a single contract. The provision attempts to bifurcate corporate law (Cayman) from employment/obligation law (Spain), but this distinction is not cleanly severable. For example, vesting terms are both corporate (share repurchase) and employment (service requirements). Non-compete provisions are both contractual obligations and employment restrictions. Under conflict of laws principles, a contract must have **one governing law** with possible carve-outs for specific mandatory provisions (e.g., Spanish employment law may be mandatory regardless of choice of law). The current language creates uncertainty about which law applies to mixed issues like acceleration on termination, repurchase mechanics, and restrictive covenants.
- **Potential Consequences**: Court may reject governing law clause entirely and apply forum law; non-compete (Section 8) may be unenforceable under Spanish law regardless of Cayman choice (Spain limits post-employment restrictions to 2 years maximum and requires compensation under Article 21 Workers' Statute); dispute over interpretation of vesting/repurchase triggers; increased litigation risk due to legal ambiguity.
- **Recommended Fix**: Replace Section 11 with: **"This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the Cayman Islands, without regard to conflicts of law principles. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the parties acknowledge that (i) any employment relationship between a Founder and the Company or its subsidiaries shall be subject to the mandatory employment laws of the jurisdiction where such employment services are performed, and (ii) the enforceability of restrictive covenants in Sections 8 and 9 shall be determined under the laws of the jurisdiction where the Founder is resident at the time of termination. For clarity, corporate matters including share issuance, vesting, repurchase rights, and equity ownership shall be governed exclusively by Cayman Islands law as the Company's lex incorporationis."**

### HIGH-3: Non-Compete Likely Unenforceable Under Spanish Law
- **File**: `Founder Agreement 29dfd07ed1c28067a9c4e1e558a67b78.md:Section 8`
- **Current Text**: "For a period of **12 months** following the termination of their relationship with the Company, a Founder shall not: [...] 2. Engage in or advise a directly competing business in the same market vertical."
- **Legal Problem**: Miguel Romera is a Spanish resident. Under Spanish Workers' Statute (Article 21), post-employment non-compete covenants are only enforceable if: (1) duration is maximum 2 years (met here), (2) employer has legitimate industrial or commercial interest (likely met for AI coaching platform), and **(3) employee receives adequate financial compensation during the restriction period**. The Agreement contains **no compensation provision** for the non-compete. Without compensation, Spanish courts will likely void this provision as unenforceable. Additionally, Spanish law disfavors founder/executive non-competes more than employee non-competes, and courts scrutinize geographic/scope restrictions. For Travis (US person), reasonableness analysis under US law (likely Delaware or state of residence) applies, and 12-month restriction is likely enforceable, but California would void it entirely if he were California resident.
- **Potential Consequences**: Company cannot enforce non-compete against Miguel if he departs and launches competing AI coaching platform; competitive harm if founder joins competitor or starts competing business; investors may view unenforceability as risk to IP/trade secret protection; potential counterclaims by Miguel for restraint of trade if Company attempts enforcement.
- **Recommended Fix**: **Option 1 (Preferred)**: Add Section 8.3: **"Non-Compete Compensation (Spanish Residents). For any Founder resident in Spain at the time of termination, the non-compete restrictions in Section 8 shall only apply if the Company elects to pay such Founder compensation equal to [50]% of such Founder's last annual base salary (or equivalent cash compensation if no salary established), payable monthly during the restriction period. The Company shall notify the Founder of its election to enforce the non-compete and commence payments within thirty (30) days of termination. If the Company does not make such election or fails to make timely payments, the non-compete restrictions shall be void and unenforceable as to such Founder."** **Option 2 (Alternative)**: Remove non-compete entirely and rely on non-solicitation, confidentiality, and IP assignment for protection. Add robust trade secret protection provisions and consider separate non-compete agreements with compensation if/when founders become employees with salaries.

### HIGH-4: Mediation in Madrid Then LCIA Arbitration Inefficient and Costly
- **File**: `Founder Agreement 29dfd07ed1c28067a9c4e1e558a67b78.md:Section 10`
- **Current Text**: "1. The Founders shall first seek resolution through mediation in Madrid, Spain. 2. Failing mediation, disputes shall be resolved by **binding arbitration** under the rules of the LCIA (London Court of International Arbitration)."
- **Legal Problem**: **Multi-step dispute resolution with mandatory mediation is expensive and slow** for early-stage founders. Requiring Madrid mediation (Spain) then LCIA arbitration (London-based) creates **three jurisdictional layers** (Spain, UK, Cayman) with corresponding travel costs, conflicting procedural rules, and delays. For a 2-founder company, this is over-engineered and creates perverse incentives to avoid dispute resolution. LCIA arbitration is **extremely expensive** (filing fees $7,500-$15,000+, arbitrator fees £350-600/hour, typically $100K-500K total cost for commercial arbitration). Early-stage founders cannot afford this. Additionally, "failing mediation" is ambiguous – how long must mediation last? Who determines when it has "failed"? This creates preliminary disputes about compliance with dispute resolution preconditions.
- **Potential Consequences**: Inability to resolve founder disputes due to cost barriers; one party may exploit mandatory mediation to delay resolution; LCIA costs could exceed company's available cash, forcing settlement under duress; practical inability to enforce repurchase rights or IP assignments; potential separate litigation over whether mediation precondition was satisfied before proceeding to arbitration.
- **Recommended Fix**: Replace Section 10 with: **"Dispute Resolution. Any dispute arising out of or relating to this Agreement shall be resolved as follows: (1) **Voluntary Mediation**: The parties may elect to engage in non-binding mediation under the JAMS International Mediation Rules or similar, with mediator and location to be mutually agreed. (2) **Binding Arbitration**: If mediation is not elected or does not result in resolution within sixty (60) days, any dispute shall be resolved by binding arbitration administered by JAMS International or the Singapore International Arbitration Centre (SIAC), under their respective streamlined/expedited rules for disputes under $250,000. The arbitration shall be conducted by a single arbitrator unless the amount in controversy exceeds $500,000. The seat of arbitration shall be London, England. The arbitration shall be conducted in English. The arbitrator's award shall be final and binding and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction. (3) **Costs**: Each party shall bear its own attorneys' fees and costs unless the arbitrator determines that one party's claims or defenses were frivolous or brought in bad faith. The parties shall share arbitrator fees and administrative costs equally unless otherwise awarded by the arbitrator."** Consider using SIAC instead of LCIA for lower costs.
