Created by: Travis Sheppard
Category: Intercompany Legal
Status: Draft for Legal Review

## Parties
- Assignor: Ai First Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Assignor")
- Assignee: Ai‑First Holdings Ltd., a Cayman Islands exempted company ("Assignee")

## Effective Date and Retroactive Coverage

**Effective Date**: This Assignment is effective as of the date of execution by both parties (the "Effective Date"), which shall be a date preceding the effective date of any employment or contractor IP assignment agreements requiring assignment of IP to Assignee.

**CRITICAL IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENT**: This Agreement MUST be fully executed with a dated Effective Date BEFORE any employment or contractor agreements are executed that reference this Agreement or require assignment of IP to Assignee.

**Retroactive Coverage**: This Assignment covers and perfects the assignment to Assignee of:

(a) All IP created, conceived, developed, or reduced to practice by Assignor or its personnel on or after the Effective Date;

(b) All IP created, conceived, developed, or reduced to practice by Assignor or its personnel prior to the Effective Date and previously held or owned by Assignor, as listed in the attached Schedules A through E;

(c) All IP created in the future by Assignor's employees, contractors, consultants, or other personnel pursuant to employment agreements, contractor agreements, or other written agreements requiring direct or successive assignment of such IP to Assignee; and

(d) All IP that has been or will be assigned to Assignor by its personnel pursuant to any present assignment language in employment or contractor agreements, which IP is hereby simultaneously assigned onward to Assignee.

**Nunc Pro Tunc Effect**: To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, Assignor confirms that this Assignment perfects and validates the present assignment language contained in all employment and contractor IP assignment agreements executed by Assignor that require direct assignment to Assignee or successive assignment (first to Assignor, then to Assignee). This Assignment operates to vest title in Assignee simultaneously with the creation of IP by Assignor's personnel, subject to applicable law.

## Assignment

Assignor hereby assigns, transfers, and conveys to Assignee all right, title, and interest
in and to any and all Intellectual Property conceived, created, developed, or reduced to
practice by Assignor or its personnel in the course of Assignor's business, including
without limitation patents, patent applications, copyrights, software, trade secrets,
know‑how, designs, data, documentation, and all associated rights worldwide, together with
the right to sue for past, present, and future infringements.

The Assigned IP includes, without limitation, all IP described in the Effective Date and Retroactive Coverage section above, as well as the specific assets listed on the attached Schedules:
Schedule A (Patents/Applications), Schedule B (Copyrights/Software), Schedule C (Trademarks),
Schedule D (Trade Secrets/Know‑how), and Schedule E (Domain Names/Social Handles).

## Further Assurances
Assignor shall execute and deliver such further instruments and take such further actions as
Assignee may reasonably request to perfect and record the assignments effected hereby.

## License Back (Operational)
Assignee grants to Assignor a non‑exclusive, royalty‑free, non‑transferable license to use
the assigned IP solely in the ordinary course of Assignor’s operations, subject to
intercompany policies.

## Consideration
As consideration for this Assignment, Assignee shall (i) assume development costs of
USD $[X] as set forth in Schedule F and (ii) pay Assignor USD $[Y], representing the fair
market value of the Assigned IP as determined by an independent valuation dated [Valuation
Date].

## Tax Compliance and Reporting

### IRS Form 926 — Transfer of Property to Foreign Corporation

**(a) Filing Requirement**: Assignor shall file **IRS Form 926 (Return by a U.S. Transferor of Property to a Foreign Corporation)** with its US federal income tax return for the taxable year that includes the Effective Date. Form 926 shall be filed in accordance with IRC §6038B and Treasury Regulation §1.6038B-1.

**(b) Information Required**: Form 926 shall include:
- (i) A complete description of all Intellectual Property transferred, organized by category (patents, copyrights, trade secrets, trademarks, know-how);
- (ii) The fair market value of each category of IP as of the Effective Date, as determined by the independent valuation referenced in the Consideration section;
- (iii) Assignor's adjusted tax basis in each category of IP;
- (iv) The amount of gain recognized (if any) on the transfer;
- (v) The percentage of Assignee's stock owned by Assignor immediately after the transfer;
- (vi) A description of the consideration received (development costs assumed + cash payment);
- (vii) Any other information required by the instructions to Form 926.

**(c) Delivery**: Assignor shall provide Assignee with a copy of the filed Form 926 within ten (10) Business Days after filing with the IRS.

**(d) Failure to File Penalty**: The parties acknowledge that failure to timely file Form 926 may result in a penalty equal to ten percent (10%) of the fair market value of the transferred property, with a minimum penalty of $100,000 under IRC §6038B(c), and that failure to file keeps the statute of limitations open indefinitely for the transfer under IRC §6501(c)(8).

### IRC §367(d) — Deemed Royalty on Transfer of Intangible Property

**(a) Deemed Royalty Requirement**: The parties acknowledge that this transfer of intangible property (patents, copyrights, trade secrets, trademarks, know-how) to a foreign corporation is subject to **IRC §367(d)** and Treasury Regulation §1.367(d)-1T. Under §367(d), Assignor must include in income each taxable year during the **useful life of the transferred intangibles** an amount equal to the **arm's length royalty** that would have been paid annually for the use of such intangibles, as if Assignor had licensed (rather than sold) the IP to Assignee.

**(b) Annual Deemed Royalty Calculation**: The parties shall cooperate annually to determine the deemed royalty amount using one of the following transfer pricing methods under Treasury Regulation §1.482-4:
- (i) **Comparable Uncontrolled Transaction (CUT) Method**: If available, based on comparable third-party IP licenses;
- (ii) **Income Method**: Based on the present value of the income attributable to the transferred IP; or
- (iii) **Comparable Profits Method (CPM)** or other reasonable method consistent with the arm's length standard.

The deemed royalty shall be calculated annually and shall reflect the actual economic benefit derived by Assignee from use of the transferred IP during each taxable year.

**(c) Duration**: The deemed royalty inclusion requirement continues for the **useful life** of each transferred intangible, or until:
- (i) Assignor disposes of all of its stock in Assignee in a transaction in which all gain is recognized;
- (ii) Assignee disposes of the transferred intangible in an arm's length sale to an unrelated third party and recognizes gain; or
- (iii) The intangible becomes worthless.

**(d) Annual §367(d) Reporting**: Assignor shall include the annual deemed royalty amount in its US federal income tax return and shall attach a statement to such return describing the calculation methodology and the amount included in income for the year.

### Transfer Pricing Documentation — IRC §482 and Treasury Regulation §1.6662-6

**(a) Contemporaneous Documentation**: The parties shall prepare and maintain **contemporaneous transfer pricing documentation** in compliance with IRC §482 and Treasury Regulation §1.6662-6 to substantiate that the consideration paid for this IP transfer (and the annual deemed royalty amounts under §367(d)) reflect arm's length pricing. Such documentation shall include:
- (i) **Functional Analysis**: Description of the functions performed, assets employed, and risks assumed by Assignor and Assignee with respect to the transferred IP;
- (ii) **Economic Analysis**: Analysis of the economic conditions affecting the pricing, including industry analysis, market conditions, and comparable transactions;
- (iii) **Selection and Application of Transfer Pricing Method**: Documentation of the selected transfer pricing method (e.g., CUT, income method, CPM) and explanation of why it provides the most reliable measure of an arm's length result;
- (iv) **Comparables Data**: If using a CUT or CPM method, documentation of comparable transactions or companies, with adjustments for material differences;
- (v) **Independent Valuation Report**: The independent valuation report determining the fair market value of the transferred IP as of the Effective Date;
- (vi) **Annual Updates**: Annual updates to the transfer pricing documentation reflecting actual results and any changes in facts and circumstances.

**(b) Best Method Rule**: The parties acknowledge that IRC §482 requires application of the "best method rule" and agree that the transfer pricing documentation shall demonstrate that the selected method provides the most reliable measure of an arm's length result under the facts and circumstances.

**(c) Penalty Protection**: The parties acknowledge that contemporaneous transfer pricing documentation meeting the requirements of Treasury Regulation §1.6662-6(d)(2)(iii) may provide penalty protection against IRC §6662 accuracy-related penalties (20% or 40% of underpayment) in the event of an IRS adjustment.

### Master File and Local File — OECD BEPS Action 13

The parties shall include this IP transfer in the Ai-First Group's **Master File** and in Assignor's **Local File** in accordance with OECD Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) Action 13 and any applicable country-by-country reporting requirements. The Master File shall describe the Group's intercompany IP ownership and licensing structure, and the Local File shall contain detailed transfer pricing analysis for this transaction.

### Annual Reporting and Cooperation

**(a) Annual Data Exchange**: Assignee shall provide to Assignor, within ninety (90) days after the end of each fiscal year, the following information necessary for Assignor to comply with Form 926, §367(d) deemed royalty reporting, and transfer pricing documentation requirements:
- (i) Financial statements showing revenue, costs, and profits attributable to the use of the transferred IP;
- (ii) Operational data (users, sales volume, geographic markets) relevant to IP valuation;
- (iii) Any changes in the use, ownership, or disposition of the transferred IP;
- (iv) Calculation of the proposed annual deemed royalty amount under §367(d) using the agreed methodology.

### Certification and Audit Trail

**(a) Initial Certification**: Within sixty (60) days after the Effective Date (or within sixty (60) days after the end of Assignor's taxable year that includes the Effective Date, whichever is later), Assignor's tax director or chief financial officer shall certify in writing to the Board of Directors that:
- (i) Form 926 has been prepared and will be filed with Assignor's next US federal income tax return (or has been filed, if the return has already been filed);

- (ii) Transfer pricing documentation has been updated to reflect the current year's facts and circumstances;
- (iii) All required tax filings related to this IP transfer are current and complete.

**(c) Audit Trail**: The parties shall maintain all documentation related to this IP transfer (including valuation reports, transfer pricing studies, Form 926, tax returns, board resolutions, and correspondence with tax advisors) for a period of **seven (7) years** from the Effective Date, or longer if required by applicable law or if the transfer is under audit or examination by any tax authority.

### Coordination with Intercompany License Agreements

This Assignment is coordinated with the Intercompany IP License Agreement between Assignee (licensor) and Assignor (licensee) dated [DATE]. The deemed royalty under §367(d) is separate from and in addition to any royalty payments made by Assignor to Assignee under such license agreement. The parties shall ensure that transfer pricing documentation addresses both the outbound assignment (this Agreement, subject to §367(d)) and the inbound license (subject to IRC §482 and withholding under IRC §§881/1441/1442).

## Recordation
The parties shall cooperate to record this Assignment with relevant IP offices (including the
USPTO and, where applicable, EUIPO/WIPO) within ninety (90) days of the Effective Date. Any
post‑assignment chain‑of‑title corrections shall be promptly executed.

## Governing Law; Dispute Resolution
This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the Cayman Islands; Assignor’s capacity and
authority are governed by Delaware law. Disputes shall be resolved by arbitration under the
LCIA Rules, seated in London, England, English language. Nothing herein precludes either party
from seeking interim injunctive relief in courts of competent jurisdiction.

## Schedules (Placeholders)
