# M-6 Implementation Summary — Intercompany Agreements

Created by: Travis Sheppard (via Claude Code)
Created time: November 2, 2025
Category: Legal Compliance — Transfer Pricing
Status: Implementation Complete - Awaiting Legal Review

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This document summarizes the implementation of M-6 from the legal review batch 1 report: creation of intercompany agreements to address transfer pricing exposure and establish proper arm's-length transactions within the Ai-First Group.

**Issue**: The legal review identified that intercompany agreements were referenced in corporate documents but not yet drafted, creating significant transfer pricing risk (IRS §482 penalties of 20-40%, Spanish tax authority adjustments, Cayman economic substance violations).

**Solution**: Three comprehensive intercompany agreements have been drafted that:
1. Implement the Ai-First Group Transfer Pricing Policy
2. Establish arm's-length pricing for IP licensing and services
3. Comply with OECD Guidelines, IRC §482, and Spanish Royal Decree 634/2015
4. Align with existing corporate governance documents
5. Create audit-ready transfer pricing documentation framework

---

## ECONOMIC SUBSTANCE REQUIREMENTS (CAYMAN)

### Why Economic Substance Matters

Cayman Islands Economic Substance Act (2018, as amended) requires Cayman entities conducting "relevant activities" to demonstrate adequate economic substance in Cayman. Failure to comply results in:
- **Penalties**: CI$100,000+ per year
- **Automatic CRS Reporting**: Tax information automatically shared with IRS, Spanish AEAT
- **Entity Strike-Off**: Cayman entity may be dissolved

### Relevant Activities for Ai-First Holdings Ltd.

**1. Intellectual Property Holding Business**:
- Ai-First Holdings owns and licenses IP to subsidiaries
- **This IS a relevant activity under the Act**
- Must demonstrate adequate substance

**2. Holding Company Business** (potentially):
- If Ai-First Holdings' primary business is equity participation in subsidiaries
- May qualify for reduced substance requirements (if "pure equity holding company")

### Substance Requirements for IP Holding

To comply with Economic Substance Act for IP holding activities, Cayman Holdings must demonstrate:

**A. Adequate Number of Qualified Employees in Cayman**:
- Option 1: Direct employees resident in Cayman performing CIGA
- Option 2: Outsource to Cayman service provider (corporate services provider)
- **Minimum**: At least 1-2 qualified employees or service provider personnel

**B. Adequate Expenditure in Cayman**:
- Salaries/fees paid to Cayman employees or service providers
- Office rent in Cayman (if physical office maintained)
- Other operating expenditure in Cayman
- **Proportionate to level of activity**

**C. Adequate Physical Assets in Cayman**:
- Office space (owned or leased) OR
- Serviced office arrangement OR
- Virtual office with corporate services provider
- **Proportionate to level of activity**

**D. Core Income Generating Activities (CIGA) in Cayman**:
For IP holding business, CIGA includes:
- Management and control of IP development and exploitation
- Assuming and managing risks related to IP
- Protecting and maintaining IP
- Making key strategic decisions regarding IP
- Managing and controlling third parties who develop, enhance, maintain, protect, or exploit IP

**Key Point**: **Board meetings in Cayman** are critical. Strategic IP decisions must be made by Cayman-resident directors or directors physically present in Cayman during board meetings.

### How Intercompany Agreements Support Economic Substance

**Services Agreement**:
- Cayman Holdings **receives** management, strategy, and governance support services from subsidiaries
- Documents that Cayman Holdings is **actively managing** the group (not just passive holding)
- Services include: financial planning, strategic planning, board meeting support, corporate governance
- **Shows Cayman Holdings has adequate resources (via services) to perform CIGA**

**IP License Agreements**:
- Cayman Holdings **actively licenses** IP to subsidiaries (not passive ownership)
- Royalties represent **active IP management** and exploitation
- Annual review and adjustment of royalty rates shows **active oversight**
- **Shows Cayman Holdings is making key IP decisions**

**Recommended Substance Actions**:
1. **Engage Cayman corporate services provider** to provide:
   - Registered office services
   - Director services (Cayman-resident director)
   - Board meeting support (in-person meetings in Cayman)
   - Corporate secretarial services
2. **Hold quarterly board meetings in Cayman** (physically present or at least some directors in Cayman)
3. **Document CIGA decisions** in board minutes:
   - IP licensing strategy and royalty rate decisions
   - Approval of intercompany agreements
   - IP protection and enforcement decisions
   - Group strategic planning and oversight
4. **Pay adequate service provider fees** (CI$20,000-50,000+ per year for substance services)
5. **File annual Economic Substance Notification and Report** with Cayman registrar

---

## WITHHOLDING TAX ANALYSIS

### US → Cayman (Delaware Inc paying royalties to Cayman Holdings)

**Tax Treaty**: United States and Cayman Islands have **NO income tax treaty**

**Withholding Rate**:
- **30%** on royalties under IRC §881(a) and §1442
- No reduction available (no treaty)

**Calculation Example**:
- Delaware Inc Net Sales: $10,000,000
- Royalty at 4%: $400,000
- Withholding at 30%: $120,000
- Net payment to Cayman: $280,000

**IRS Filing**:
- **Form 1042**: Annual Withholding Tax Return for U.S. Source Income of Foreign Persons
- **Form 1042-S**: Foreign Person's U.S. Source Income Subject to Withholding (provided to Cayman Holdings)

**Planning Considerations**:
- **30% is very high** and significantly reduces effective royalty rate
- Alternatives to consider:
  - IP holding in jurisdiction with better US treaty (Ireland, Netherlands, Luxembourg) - but adds complexity
  - Cost-sharing arrangement instead of royalty (more complex, requires significant substance)
  - Reduce royalty rate and increase service fees (but must be arm's-length)
- **For now**: Accept 30% withholding as cost of Cayman structure

### Spain → Cayman (Spain SL paying royalties to Cayman Holdings)

**Tax Treaty**: Spain and Cayman Islands have **NO income tax treaty**

**Withholding Rate**:
- **19%** on royalties under Spanish Corporate Income Tax Law (Ley del Impuesto sobre Sociedades, Art. 25)
- **24%** if payer to tax haven jurisdiction (potential Cayman classification, but likely 19% applies for inter-company)

**Calculation Example**:
- Spain SL Net Sales: €5,000,000
- Royalty at 4%: €200,000
- Withholding at 19%: €38,000
- Net payment to Cayman: €162,000

**Spanish Tax Filing**:
- **Modelo 296**: Quarterly withholding return (resumen anual / annual summary)
- **Modelo 232**: Annual related-party transaction disclosure (includes gross royalty before withholding)

**Planning Considerations**:
- **19% is moderately high** but better than US 30%
- **EU IP Box regimes** (e.g., Netherlands, Luxembourg) offer reduced withholding for EU→EU, but Cayman is outside EU
- Alternatives:
  - Intermediate EU holding company (adds complexity and substance requirements)
  - Cost-sharing or services model (but royalty is most appropriate for IP licensing)
- **For now**: Accept 19% withholding

### Services (Cayman → Delaware/Spain)

**Cayman Paying for Services**:
- **No Cayman withholding**: Cayman has no corporate income tax or withholding tax
- **Service providers** report income in their jurisdictions (US, Spain)
- **No withholding required** on services payments from Cayman
