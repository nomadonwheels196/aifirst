**IMPORTANT TAX NOTICE (US Taxpayers):** If you are a US taxpayer, consult a tax advisor
immediately regarding the advisability of filing an election under Section 83(b) of the US
Internal Revenue Code. This election must be filed with the IRS within thirty (30) days of
the purchase date; the deadline is not extendable. Failure to file timely may result in
ordinary income recognition at each vesting date based on the then-current fair market value
of the Shares. The Founder is responsible for filing any such election and for providing a
copy to the Company for its records.

### **Reverse Vesting and Repurchase Rights**

The Shares issued under this Agreement are subject to the Company’s right to repurchase any unvested shares in accordance with the vesting schedule and reverse vesting provisions set forth in the Founder Agreement. The repurchase price for any unvested shares shall be the original issue price (nominal value) and no FMV determination shall be required for such repurchases. The Founder acknowledges that all unvested shares are held by the Founder in trust for the benefit of the Company and agrees to execute any documents necessary to give effect to the Company’s repurchase right upon termination of service. For clarity, shares acquired by the Founder in any secondary transaction are not subject to reverse vesting under this Agreement unless an express written agreement provides otherwise.

## Definitions

**“Vesting Commencement Date”** means the date of the Founder’s commencement of full-time service with the Company.

**“Cliff”** means the initial period during which no shares vest, after which a specified portion vests immediately.

**“Reverse Vesting”** means the mechanism by which the Founder holds legal title to all issued shares but the Company retains the right to repurchase unvested shares upon termination.
