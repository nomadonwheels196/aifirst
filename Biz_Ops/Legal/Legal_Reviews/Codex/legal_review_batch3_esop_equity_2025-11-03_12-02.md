# Legal Review – Ai‑First (Batch 3: ESOP & Equity)
**Date**: ${TS}
**Scope**: Equity Incentive Plan, ESOP Plan, Sub‑Plans (US/EU), Grant Template, Equity Issuance Appendix
**Jurisdictions**: Cayman corporate; USA tax (409A/422(d)); Spain/EU employment references

## Executive Summary
US Sub‑Plan documents §422(d) $100k ISO limit (ordering/reclassification) and early exercise with §83(b). Main risk is the “void ab initio” remedy, which should be softened to a reformation/cure standard.

### Risk Dashboard
- High‑Risk: 1 • Medium‑Risk: 2 • Low‑Risk: 2 • Compliant: 3

## High‑Risk
### H1: 409A remedy over‑rigid (“void ab initio”)
- Files: ESOP_Equity/ESOP Sub-Plan US (409A, ISOs-NSOs).md:50; ESOP_Equity/ESOP Plan.md:177
- Fix: Replace with “reform to comply with §409A” and corrective steps to minimize tax harm.

## Medium‑Risk
- M1: Grant template placeholders [•] require completion per grant.
- M2: Ensure FMV date aligns with grant date and §409A.

## Low‑Risk / Compliant
- L1: Early exercise and §83(b) notices present.
- L2: Equity Issuance Appendix implements super pro‑rata (10%) and waterfall.

## Recommended Actions (Batch 3)
- Redline remedy language; confirm processes for 409A refresh after material events.
