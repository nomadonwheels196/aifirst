# Spain Board Regulations — Ai‑First Spain, S.L. (Draft)

Created by: Travis Sheppard
Category: Corporate Legal — Spain
Status: Draft for Legal Review

## 1. Purpose
These Regulations complement the Estatutos, detailing Board procedures consistent with the LSC.

## 1bis. Definitions
- Business Day: any day other than Saturday, Sunday, or public holiday when banks are open in the Company’s principal place of business in Spain.

## 2. Meetings
- Notice: at least 48 hours, unless urgent.
- Format: in person, video, or mixed; unanimous written resolutions allowed.

## 3. Quorum and Voting
- Quorum: majority of directors.
- Majority: simple majority of attendees.
- Casting Vote: In case of a tie, the Chair has a casting vote, subject to the restrictions set forth in the Estatutos (Bylaws). The casting vote cannot be exercised when the Chair has a conflict of interest as defined in LSC Articles 228-230, on Reserved Matters requiring reinforced majorities, on matters related to the Chair's own appointment/removal/compensation, or on related-party transactions in which the Chair has direct or indirect interest. If the casting vote cannot be exercised, escalate per Section 5.

## 4. Conflicts of Interest
Directors must declare conflicts of interest in accordance with LSC Articles 228-230. A conflicted director must:
- Declare the conflict before deliberation begins
- Abstain from deliberation and voting on the conflicted matter
- Leave the meeting room during deliberation (unless the Board requests their presence for informational purposes)
- Not exercise casting vote if serving as Chair

Conflicts of interest include but are not limited to: related-party transactions, competing activities, usurpation of corporate opportunities, and situations where the director or related parties (family members, controlled entities) have direct or indirect personal interest in the matter.

## 5. Deadlock and Escalation
If a tie persists on a Reserved Matter after ten (10) Business Days of cooling‑off and further good‑faith discussion, escalate to an Independent Director; failing that, mediation before Cámara de Comercio de Madrid.

## 6. Secretary and Minutes
The Secretary records minutes, resolutions, and attendance; certifications may be issued by the Secretary with Chair's approval.

## 7. Classification of Service Providers (Spanish Law Compliance)

### 7.1 Legal Framework

All individuals providing services to Ai-First Spain, S.L. shall be classified as employees (empleados) or independent contractors (autónomos) in strict compliance with:
- **Estatuto de los Trabajadores** (Royal Legislative Decree 2/2015)
- **Ley General de la Seguridad Social** (Royal Legislative Decree 8/2015)
- **Ley 20/2007 del Estatuto del Trabajo Autónomo** (TRADE - Economically Dependent Contractors)
- Applicable jurisprudence of the Tribunal Supremo and Tribunales Superiores de Justicia
- Criteria established by the Tesorería General de la Seguridad Social (TGSS)
- Inspección de Trabajo y Seguridad Social guidance

### 7.2 Presumption of Employment (ET Art. 8.1)

Pursuant to **Article 8.1 of the Estatuto de los Trabajadores**, there is a **rebuttable presumption** that any person providing services within the Company's organizational scope and subject to the Company's direction is an **employee** (empleado). The burden is on the Company to demonstrate autonomous contractor (autónomo) status by objective written evidence and compliance with all TRADE requirements if applicable.

The Company acknowledges that Spanish labor authorities (TGSS and Inspección de Trabajo) aggressively enforce this presumption and that misclassification carries severe financial and legal consequences, including:
- Retroactive social security contributions (≈30% of compensation) for up to 4 years
- Penalties ranging from 150% to 225% of unpaid contributions
- Additional labor law fines for violations of ET provisions
- Potential personal liability for directors for unpaid social security debts under LGSS Article 18
- Claims for unfair dismissal (despido improcedente) with severance up to 33 days' pay per year of service

### 7.3 Employee Indicators (ET Criteria)

**(h) Multiple Clients**:

### 7.5 TRADE (Economically Dependent Contractor) Requirements

If the Company engages an economically dependent contractor (worker derives >75% of professional income from Company), the engagement **must** comply with **Ley 20/2007 (TRADE)** requirements:

**(a) Written Contract**: Contract must include:
- Identification of parties and TRADE status

### 7.6 Mandatory Pre-Engagement Review

Prior to engaging any contractor (autónomo or TRADE), the following procedure is **mandatory**:

**(a) Legal Review**:
- Spanish labor counsel reviews proposed scope of work, contract, and relationship

- Register includes: name, services, start date, contract term, renewal dates, classification, income percentage
- Register reviewed quarterly by Board

### 7.7 Conservative Default Rule

**If in doubt, classify as employee (empleado).**

The Company acknowledges that the cost of misclassification (retroactive social security contributions + penalties of 150-225% + labor law fines + severance claims) vastly exceeds the cost of employing a person who could arguably have been classified as a contractor.

When any of the employee indicators in Section 7.3 are present, or when the relationship does not clearly exhibit **all** of the autonomous contractor indicators in Section 7.4, the individual **shall** be classified as an employee and an employment contract compliant with the Estatuto de los Trabajadores shall be executed.

### 7.8 Annual Audit and Ongoing Compliance

**(a) Annual Audit**: The Board shall cause external Spanish labor counsel to conduct an annual audit of all contractor relationships (autónomos and TRADE) to:
- Verify ongoing compliance with classification criteria
- Identify any relationships requiring reclassification as employees
- Review contract renewals and extensions for compliance
- Assess changes in circumstances affecting classification

**(b) Quarterly Review**: The Board shall review the contractor compliance register quarterly to monitor:
- New contractor engagements since last review
- Changes in scope or terms of existing contractors
- Economic dependence trends (income percentages)
- Upcoming contract renewals or terminations

**(c) Immediate Reclassification**: If audit or review identifies a misclassified contractor:
- Immediately reclassify as employee
- Execute compliant employment contract retroactive to service commencement date
- Engage Spanish labor counsel for voluntary regularization with TGSS
- File corrective social security returns to minimize penalties

**(d) Voluntary Disclosure**: If misclassification discovered, the Company shall:
- Engage Spanish labor counsel and social security advisor immediately
- Prepare voluntary disclosure to TGSS under regularization program
- Calculate and pay retroactive social security contributions plus reduced penalties
- Document corrective actions in Board minutes

## 8. Effective Date
Effective upon registration of the company and adoption by the Board.
