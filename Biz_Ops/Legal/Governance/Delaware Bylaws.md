Created by: Travis Sheppard
Category: Corporate Legal — Delaware
Status: Draft for Legal Review

## Article I — Offices
Registered office and agent in Delaware; other offices as determined by the Board.

## Article II — Meetings of Stockholders
Meetings, notice, quorum, and voting as per DGCL and these Bylaws.

## Article III — Board of Directors
- Management: Business managed by or under direction of the Board (DGCL §141).
- Number and Qualification: As fixed by Board or stockholders.
- Quorum: A majority of directors then in office constitutes a quorum.
- Voting: The act of a majority of directors present at a meeting at which a quorum is present shall be the act of the Board.
- Chair’s Casting Vote: If a quorum is present and the vote results in a tie, the Chair of the Board shall have an additional casting vote solely to break the tie. The casting vote may not be exercised if the Chair has a disqualifying conflict under the Corporation’s conflict‑of‑interest policy.

### Annual Election of Directors; Removal for Cause Only
- **Annual Election**: All directors shall be elected annually for one-year terms expiring at the next annual meeting of stockholders. There shall be no classified or staggered board structure.
- **Rationale for Declassification**: The Corporation has adopted an annual election structure (rather than a classified/staggered board) to:
  - (i) Facilitate institutional venture capital financing by aligning with standard VC governance expectations;
  - (ii) Maximize director accountability through annual stockholder review;
  - (iii) Avoid potential delays or complications in future M&A transactions or IPO processes where acquirers or underwriters may require board declassification;
  - (iv) Maintain flexibility for the Corporation's governance to evolve with the Company's growth stage and stakeholder composition.
- **Removal for Cause Only**: Subject to the Certificate of Incorporation and applicable law, any Director may be removed from office by the stockholders only for Cause.
- **Definition of "Cause"**: "Cause" means (a) conviction of a felony; (b) fraud or willful misconduct resulting in material injury to the Corporation; or (c) final adjudication of a material breach of fiduciary duty.

### Reserved Matters Quorum Safeguard (Bylaw Acknowledgment)
- For matters designated as “Reserved Matters” in the Company’s shareholders or voting agreements, the presence of at least one Founder‑designated Director shall be required to constitute a quorum for Board action on such matters.

### Founder‑Designated Seat Permanence Until Qualified IPO
- The Corporation shall maintain at least one Founder‑designated Director seat, which shall not be eliminated, reclassified, or reduced prior to a Qualified IPO, except as permitted under Removal for Cause Only and with any approvals required under the Certificate of Incorporation and applicable law.

### Board Reconstitution Guardrails (Pre‑IPO)
- Prior to a Qualified IPO, any change to the size or composition of the Board (including elimination or reclassification of seats or reconstitution of committees that would remove Founder control over Reserved Matters) shall: (i) comply with the Certificate of Incorporation and applicable law; (ii) maintain at least one Founder‑designated Director seat; and (iii) be subject to any approvals required under applicable shareholders or voting agreements, including separate consent of holders of Class B shares if designated a Reserved Matter.

### Definitions
- Qualified IPO: a firm‑commitment underwritten public offering of the Corporation’s equity securities pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933 resulting in aggregate gross proceeds to the Corporation of not less than USD 75,000,000 (or EUR equivalent at the ECB reference rate on the pricing date) and listing on the NYSE, Nasdaq, or another recognized national securities exchange.

## Article IV — Officers
Appointment, powers, and removal of officers as determined by the Board.

## Article V — Committees
The Board may designate committees; committees have board‑delegated authority to the extent permitted by DGCL.

## Article VI — Indemnification and Advancement
To the fullest extent permitted by law, as set forth in a separate indemnification policy and the Certificate of Incorporation.

## Article VII — Amendments
These Bylaws may be altered, amended, or repealed by the Board or stockholders, subject to the Certificate of Incorporation and DGCL.

## Article VIII — Stockholders Agreements; Recognized Transfers
The Corporation may enter into, and the Board may approve, one or more stockholders or voting agreements that provide for transfer restrictions and/or transfer mechanisms, including buy–sell or fair market value exit provisions. Transfers consummated in accordance with any such approved agreement shall be recognized on the Corporation’s books upon delivery of customary transfer documents and compliance with applicable law.

For governance clarity, to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware law and the Certificate of Incorporation, the Board shall give effect to founder‑protective governance provisions contained in any duly approved shareholders or voting agreement, including, as applicable, the maintenance of a founder‑designated director seat prior to a Qualified IPO, quorum safeguards for Reserved Matters, and any super‑voting or class consent requirements reflected in the Certificate of Incorporation.

## Article IX — Liquidity Events; Board Approval
For clarity and without limiting DGCL requirements, any merger, consolidation, sale of all or substantially all assets, or dissolution (each, a "Liquidity Event") must be approved by the Board before submission to stockholders, and any such transaction shall be processed in accordance with the Certificate of Incorporation and applicable law.
