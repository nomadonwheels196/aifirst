## Ai‑First Inc. (Delaware C‑Corp) – Founder Agreement (Draft)

Version 0.1 – Draft for Internal Alignment (US Operations)

---

## 1. Parties

This Founder Agreement ("Agreement") is entered into as of [Date] by and among the
undersigned individuals (each, a "Founder," and collectively, the "Founders") and
**Ai‑First Inc.**, a Delaware corporation (the "Company").

---

## 2. Purpose

The Founders are entering into this Agreement to:
- Establish equity issuance and reverse vesting terms for US operations;
- Define roles, responsibilities, and decision-making processes; and
- Protect confidential information and ensure IP alignment with the Group structure.

---

## 3. Equity Ownership & Vesting

### 3.1 Initial Ownership

Each Founder shall be issued shares of the Company’s Common Stock as authorized by the
Board and documented in a separate Restricted Stock Purchase Agreement (Delaware).

### 3.2 Vesting Schedule

All Founder shares issued by the Company are subject to a four (4) year vesting schedule
with a one (1) year cliff. Twenty‑five percent (25%) shall vest on the first anniversary of
the Vesting Commencement Date (the "Cliff"), and the remaining seventy‑five percent (75%)
shall vest in equal monthly installments over the subsequent thirty‑six (36) months,
subject to the Founder’s continued service to the Company. In the event of any conflict
between this Agreement and a Founder’s Restricted Stock Purchase Agreement (Delaware), the
vesting schedule in this Section 3.2 shall control.

### 3.3 Reverse Vesting and Repurchase Right

**3.3.1 Repurchase Right**

All Founder shares are issued subject to the Company's irrevocable right to repurchase any unvested shares upon termination of service for any reason, including resignation, termination with or without cause, or voluntary departure.

**3.3.2 Repurchase Price**

The repurchase price for unvested Founder shares shall be the **original issue price** paid by the Founder (the "Issue Price"), which shall be the par value ($0.0001 per share) unless the Founder paid a higher price at issuance. For the avoidance of doubt:

(a) "Original issue price" means the price per share actually paid by the Founder in cash or other consideration upon initial issuance of the shares as documented in the Restricted Stock Purchase Agreement (Delaware);

(b) If shares were issued for services or for nominal consideration, the original issue price shall be deemed to be the par value ($0.0001 per share);

(c) The repurchase price shall **not** be adjusted for fair market value appreciation, subsequent financing rounds, or any independent valuation of the Company;

(d) Any shares acquired by a Founder in a secondary transaction (i.e., other than original issuance under this Agreement or the Restricted Stock Purchase Agreement) are excluded from the reverse vesting repurchase mechanism unless expressly subjected to reverse vesting by written agreement.

**3.3.3 Procedure and Timeline**

(a) **Notice**: Within ten (10) Business Days after a Founder's termination of service, the Company may deliver written notice to the Founder (or the Founder's legal representative or estate) of its election to exercise the repurchase right (the "Repurchase Notice"). The Repurchase Notice shall specify:
- (i) The number of unvested shares subject to repurchase;
- (ii) The aggregate repurchase price (Issue Price × number of shares);
- (iii) The proposed closing date (not less than ten (10) nor more than twenty (20) Business Days after the Repurchase Notice);
- (iv) Wire transfer instructions or other payment method.

(b) **Closing**: The repurchase shall close on the date specified in the Repurchase Notice (the "Closing Date"). At closing:
- (i) The Company shall pay the aggregate repurchase price in immediately available funds by wire transfer, certified check, or cashier's check;
- (ii) The Founder shall deliver the stock certificates (or execute electronic transfer instructions if shares are held in book-entry form) duly endorsed for transfer, together with executed stock transfer forms and any other documents reasonably requested by the Company's transfer agent;
- (iii) The Company shall cancel the stock certificates and update the stock ledger to reflect the repurchase.

(c) **Failure to Deliver Shares**: If the Founder fails to deliver the stock certificates or execute required transfer documents within five (5) Business Days after the Closing Date, the Company may:
- (i) Place the aggregate repurchase price in an interest-bearing escrow account maintained by a licensed escrow agent or the Company's legal counsel for the Founder's benefit; and
- (ii) Cancel the stock certificates and make appropriate entries in the stock ledger to reflect the repurchase, which entries shall be effective to transfer legal and beneficial ownership to the Company.

(d) **Escrow Alternative**: The Company may, at its option and by written agreement with the Founder at the time of issuance, require that unvested Founder shares be held in escrow with an independent escrow agent (or the Company's legal counsel as escrow agent) together with an undated stock power pending vesting. If shares are held in escrow, the escrow agent shall release shares to the Company upon receipt of a Repurchase Notice and confirmation of payment of the repurchase price to the Founder.

**3.3.4 Automatic Lapse**

The Company's repurchase right shall **automatically lapse** as shares vest according to the vesting schedule in Section 3.2. The Company's failure to deliver a Repurchase Notice within ten (10) Business Days after termination of service shall constitute an irrevocable waiver of the repurchase right for those unvested shares, unless the Founder agrees in writing to extend the notice period.

**3.3.5 Death or Disability Exception**

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Founder's termination of service is due to:
- (a) **Death**: The Founder's death; or
- (b) **Permanent Disability**: The Founder's inability to perform the essential functions of their role for a period of more than one hundred twenty (120) consecutive days due to physical or mental incapacity, as certified by a licensed physician;

then **one hundred percent (100%)** of the Founder's unvested shares shall immediately vest and shall **not** be subject to the Company's repurchase right. The accelerated vesting under this Section 3.3.5 is in addition to any other acceleration provisions in this Agreement.

**3.3.6 Delaware Law Compliance**

The repurchase shall comply with the requirements of the Delaware General Corporation Law (DGCL), including:
- (a) The repurchase is authorized by the Company's Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws;
- (b) The repurchase will not impair the capital of the Company under DGCL §160 (the Company has legally available surplus or the repurchase is from capital and will not reduce net assets below stated capital); and
- (c) If the Board determines that the repurchase would violate DGCL §160 or render the Company insolvent, the Company shall not proceed with the repurchase.

**3.3.7 Tax Treatment and Acknowledgment**

Founders acknowledge that:
- (a) The repurchase at Issue Price may have tax consequences under US federal and state tax law (including potential ordinary income under IRC §83, capital gain/loss, or other treatment);
- (b) The Company makes no representations or warranties regarding the tax treatment of the repurchase;
- (c) Each Founder is solely responsible for consulting their own tax advisors regarding the tax consequences of the reverse vesting structure and any repurchase, including the advisability of making an IRC §83(b) election;
- (d) The repurchase may be treated as a non-recognition transaction, a sale, or compensation for services, depending on the facts and circumstances and applicable tax law; and
- (e) If the Founder made an IRC §83(b) election upon issuance of unvested shares, the Founder may realize a capital loss upon repurchase if the repurchase price is less than the amount included in income pursuant to the §83(b) election.

**3.3.8 Board Waiver**

The Board may waive the repurchase right in whole or in part by written resolution, provided that any such waiver is documented in Board minutes and does not discriminate among similarly situated Founders without reasonable business justification.

### 3.4 Acceleration

Upon a Change of Control of the Company, fifty percent (50%) of a Founder's then‑unvested
shares shall accelerate and the remainder shall continue to vest over the next twelve (12)
months, subject to continued service. Any additional acceleration shall be determined by the
Board or as set forth in the Founder's Restricted Stock Purchase Agreement (Delaware).

For purposes of this Agreement, "Change of Control" has the meaning set forth in the Shareholders Agreement of Ai-First Holdings Ltd. (the Company's parent), and means, within any twelve (12) month period: (i) any person or group becomes the beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of more than fifty percent (50%) of the total voting power of the parent company's outstanding voting securities; (ii) a sale, transfer, or disposition of more than fifty percent (50%) of the parent company's assets (measured by fair market value); (iii) a merger, consolidation, or similar reorganization after which the holders of the parent company's voting securities immediately prior to such transaction own less than fifty percent (50%) of the total voting power of the surviving or resulting entity immediately after such transaction; (iv) during any period of twelve (12) consecutive months, a majority of the members of the parent company's Board is replaced by individuals whose appointment or election is not endorsed by a majority of the members of the Board prior to the date of such appointment or election; or (v) the consummation of a Qualified IPO. For US taxpayers, this definition shall be construed consistently with Treasury Regulation §1.409A-3(i)(5) and Internal Revenue Code §280G(b)(2)(A) to the extent applicable.

## 4. Roles & Responsibilities

Each Founder shall devote professional efforts to Company activities, act in the best
interests of the Company, avoid conflicts of interest, and comply with policies adopted by
the Board. Leadership roles may evolve as the Company grows and may be modified by Board
resolution.

## 4bis. Employment and Tax Status

### 4bis.1 Officer Status

Each Founder shall serve as an Officer of the Company as designated by the Board of Directors. Founders who are US citizens or tax residents and who perform substantial services for the Company shall be classified as common-law employees for US federal and state tax purposes.

### 4bis.2 Employment Agreement Requirement

**(a) US Founders**: Any Founder who is a US citizen or tax resident and who performs substantial services for the Company shall execute a formal employment agreement with the Company documenting:
- Officer title and duties;
- Compensation (salary, bonus, equity);
- At-will employment status;
- Tax withholding obligations (FICA, Medicare, federal and state income tax);
- Benefits eligibility (health insurance, 401(k), etc.); and
- Compliance with all applicable employment laws.

**(b) Classification Analysis**: The Company shall engage qualified employment tax counsel to prepare a written classification analysis confirming that Founders providing services to the Company are properly classified as employees (rather than independent contractors) for purposes of:
- Internal Revenue Code and Treasury Regulations;
- State employment and unemployment insurance laws;
- Worker classification tests under applicable law; and
- Securities law (employee status for equity grant purposes).

The classification analysis and rationale shall be documented in Board minutes.

### 4bis.3 Tax Withholding and Reporting

**(a) Withholding**: The Company shall withhold all required employment taxes from Founder compensation, including:
- Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA) — Social Security and Medicare (employee and employer portions);
- Federal income tax withholding based on Form W-4;
- State income tax withholding (if applicable);
- State unemployment insurance (SUI);
- State disability insurance (SDI) where applicable (e.g., California); and

**(c) Founder Responsibility**: Each Founder acknowledges responsibility for their individual income tax obligations arising from employment compensation, equity compensation, and equity sales.

### 4bis.4 No Dual Status

A Founder may not simultaneously be classified as an independent contractor and employee for the same services provided to the Company. Any Founder who performs services exclusively as a Director (attending Board meetings, governance) without operational duties may be classified as an independent contractor, but only if:
- The Founder does not perform day-to-day operational or management services;
- The classification is documented in a Board resolution with supporting rationale;
- The Founder executes an independent contractor agreement; and
- The Founder receives Form 1099-NEC (not Form W-2).

### 4bis.5 Retroactive Effective Date and Tax Correction

To the extent any Founder has provided services to the Company prior to the date of this Agreement without proper employment classification or tax withholding:

**(a)** The Founder agrees to execute an employment agreement with the Company with a retroactive effective date covering all historical services from the date services commenced;

**(b)** The Company shall, in consultation with qualified employment tax counsel, file corrective employment tax returns:
- Form 941-X (Adjusted Employer's Quarterly Federal Tax Return) for all affected quarters;
- State equivalents (e.g., California DE 9C, New York NYS-45-X);
- Form 940 amendments if unemployment tax was not paid;
to correct any periods where Founder services were provided but employment taxes were not withheld;

**(c)** The Company shall engage employment tax counsel to prepare voluntary disclosure submissions to the IRS and applicable state tax authorities under the IRS Voluntary Classification Settlement Program (VCSP) or similar state programs to minimize penalties and interest;

**(d)** **Personal Liability Protection**: Any employment taxes, penalties, or interest assessed on the Company arising from historical misclassification shall be the responsibility of the Company; Founders shall not be personally liable for employer portions of such amounts. However, Founders acknowledge they remain liable for the employee portion of FICA and withheld income taxes as required by law; and

**(e)** **IRC §6672 Acknowledgment**: Founders acknowledge that under IRC §6672, responsible persons who willfully fail to collect, account for, or pay over employment taxes may be personally liable for a penalty equal to 100% of unpaid taxes. To avoid such liability, the Company shall engage qualified tax counsel to ensure compliance with all corrective filing and payment obligations.

### 4bis.6 Coordination with Equity Grants

For purposes of equity compensation under the Company's stock option plans or the Ai-First Holdings Ltd. ESOP:

**(a)** Founders who are classified as employees of the Company shall be eligible for employee-only equity grants, including Incentive Stock Options (ISOs) under IRC §422, subject to compliance with all applicable requirements including 409A valuation;

**(b)** Founders who provide services exclusively as Directors or independent contractors shall be eligible only for non-employee equity grants (Non-Qualified Stock Options);

**(c)** The Administrator of any equity plan shall verify employment status before making any grant to ensure compliance with IRC §422 (ISOs), IRC §409A (deferred compensation), and securities laws (Form S-8 registration eligibility); and

proprietary information and use them solely for Company purposes. These obligations survive
termination.

To maintain Group‑level IP centralization, each Founder acknowledges and agrees that all
Intellectual Property conceived, created, developed, or reduced to practice by such Founder
in connection with services to the Company is and shall be owned by **Ai‑First Holdings
Ltd. (Cayman)**, and the Company shall receive rights to such IP pursuant to intercompany
license agreements between Ai‑First Holdings Ltd. (Cayman) and the Company. Without
limitation, each Founder hereby irrevocably assigns to Ai‑First Holdings Ltd. (Cayman) all
right, title, and interest in and to such Intellectual Property on the same terms set forth
