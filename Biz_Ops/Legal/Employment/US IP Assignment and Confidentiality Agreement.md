**2.1 Work Made for Hire for Parent**

To the fullest extent permitted by law, all works of authorship (including copyrightable works such as software, documentation, specifications, designs, databases, user interfaces, and related materials) created by Employee in performing services for the Company shall be deemed "**works made for hire**" under 17 U.S.C. §101 for **Ai-First Holdings Ltd., a Cayman Islands exempted company** ("Parent"), and Parent shall own all right, title, and interest therein, including all copyrights and related rights. To the extent not qualifying as works made for hire for Parent under applicable law, such works shall be deemed works made for hire for Company, which shall immediately assign them to Parent as set forth in Section 2.4 below.

**2.2 Scope of Assigned IP**

"Intellectual Property" includes all inventions, discoveries, ideas, works of authorship (including software and documentation), designs, mask works, databases and data, algorithms, trade secrets, know‑how, processes, trademarks, and all applications, registrations, and extensions thereof worldwide. "Assigned IP" means all Intellectual Property created, conceived, developed, or reduced to practice by Employee, solely or jointly, during employment that: (i) relates to the Company's actual or demonstrably anticipated business, research, or development; (ii) results from any work performed by Employee for the Company; or (iii) is developed using the Company's equipment, supplies, facilities, or trade secrets.

**2.3 Future Assistance**

Employee will promptly disclose Assigned IP to the Company and execute documents and take actions reasonably requested to perfect, maintain, register, or enforce Company's or Parent's rights, including patent assignments and copyright registrations. If Employee is unavailable, Employee irrevocably designates Company as attorney‑in‑fact for such limited purposes.

**2.4 Chain of Title; Direct and Successive Assignment**

(a) **Direct Assignment to Parent**: Employee hereby assigns, transfers, and conveys to **Ai-First Holdings Ltd., a Cayman Islands exempted company** ("Parent"), all right, title, and interest in and to all Assigned IP, effective immediately upon creation.

(b) **Successive Assignment**: To the extent that Assigned IP is deemed under applicable law to vest initially in Employee or in Company, Employee hereby assigns such IP first to Company, and Company, as agent for Parent and by execution of this Agreement through the undersigned authorized officer, hereby simultaneously assigns such IP to Parent.

(c) **Perfection**: Employee shall execute any additional documents reasonably requested by Company or Parent to perfect Parent's ownership, including direct assignments to Parent for recordation with the USPTO or other IP offices.

(d) **Acknowledgment**: Company represents that it has full authority to effect the successive assignment set forth in subsection (b) pursuant to the Intercompany IP Assignment Agreement between Company and Parent dated [EXECUTED DATE - to be inserted upon intercompany agreement execution].

(e) **No Gap in Chain of Title**: Employee acknowledges that the purpose of subsections (a) and (b) is to ensure that title to all Assigned IP vests in Parent immediately upon creation, without any gap in chain of title, whether by direct assignment or by successive assignment through Company as agent.

develops entirely on Employee’s own time without using Company equipment, supplies,

for Company, to the extent provided by applicable state law.
