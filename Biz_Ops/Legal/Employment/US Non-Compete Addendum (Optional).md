Status: Optional addendum for enforceable non‑compete where permitted

This Non‑Compete Addendum (the "Addendum") is entered into by and between **Ai First Inc.**
(the "Company") and **[Employee Name]** (the "Employee") as of **[Date]** and supplements the
Employment Agreement dated **[Employment Agreement Date]**.

1. Consideration
In consideration for the covenants in this Addendum, the Company shall pay Employee a
non‑compete consideration payment of **$[amount, e.g., $1,000 or 10% of annual base salary]**,
payable **[upon execution / upon termination if the non‑compete applies]**. This payment is in
addition to all other compensation and is independent consideration for these covenants.

2. Non‑Compete Covenant (Limited Scope)
For a period of **[12] months** following termination, the Employee shall not serve in a
substantially similar role (as defined below) for any direct competitor listed on **Schedule A
(Competitor List)** within **[geographic scope, e.g., the United States or within 50 miles of
Company locations]**. “Substantially similar role” means a position with materially similar
functions and responsibilities to the position held with the Company in the twelve (12) months
prior to termination.

3. Carve‑Outs and State‑Specific Restrictions
This Addendum shall be void and unenforceable if the Employee’s principal place of work is in
California, Oklahoma, North Dakota, the District of Columbia, or any jurisdiction that
prohibits or materially restricts non‑compete agreements by statute. In such jurisdictions,
the Company will rely solely on non‑solicitation, confidentiality, trade secrets, and IP
assignment provisions.

4. Blue‑Pencil and Reasonableness
If any provision of this Addendum is found unenforceable, the parties agree that a court may
modify the provision to the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable under applicable
law and enforce it as modified. The parties acknowledge the restrictions herein are reasonable
in scope, territory, and duration to protect the Company’s legitimate interests in trade
secrets, confidential information, and customer goodwill.

5. No Change to At‑Will Status
Nothing in this Addendum alters the at‑will nature of employment.
