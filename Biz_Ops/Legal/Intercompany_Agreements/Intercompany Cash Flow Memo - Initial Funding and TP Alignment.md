Date: [Date]
Prepared by: [Name]

## 1. Purpose
Document how founder‑funded working capital flows from the parent to operating entities in line with the Group’s intercompany agreements, TP Policy, and Cayman ESA.

## 2. Source of Funds
- Parent receives founder equity proceeds and/or founder loan draws (see Board Consent — Loan Facility).
- Board minutes (Cayman) record the funding decision as a CIGA item (ESA evidence).

## 3. Downstream Flows
- Capital Contributions: Parent → US Inc. and/or Spain S.L. for baseline capitalization (no repayment; record in equity). Use for hiring and fixed costs.
- Intercompany Loans: Parent → US/Spain for short‑term working capital (board‑approved note; arm’s‑length AFR+ / local rate; maturity < 24 months). Track interest and repayments.
- Service Prepayments: Parent prepays service fees under the Intercompany Services Agreement to smooth cash; quarterly true‑up per TP Policy.

## 4. Operating Flows (Quarterly)
- IP Royalties: US/Spain pay Parent standard royalty (3–5% of gross revenue) per IP License; withhold taxes per WHT schedule (US 1042/1042‑S; Spain 216/296).
- Services: Parent pays US/Spain cost+ mark‑ups (US/Spain provide R&D/ops); annual true‑up to benchmarking ranges.

## 5. Compliance Artifacts
- Cayman ESA: agendas/minutes; evidence log (see ESA Evidence Checklist).
- TP Policy: benchmarking extracts; true‑up workpapers.
- WHT: filings and certificates; Form W‑8BEN‑E on file; Spain Modelo 216/296.
- Data: SCC Annex I/II/III executed; TIA approved by DPO; TOMs documented.

## 6. Governance
- Approvals: Cayman Board approves material licenses (> USD 100k) and risk matters; CFO executes routine payments under signed agreements.
- Reporting: Quarterly package to Parent Board (cash, intercompany balances, TP true‑ups, ESA evidence updates).

## 7. Notes
- Avoid excessive intercompany receivables; settle quarterly.
- Track loan balances and interest accruals for US/Spain tax.
