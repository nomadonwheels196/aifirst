**Prepared by:** Travis Sheppard (via Claude Code)
**Date:** November 2, 2025
**Status:** Draft for Legal & Tax Counsel Review

**IMPORTANT NOTES FOR COUNSEL:**

1. **Transfer Pricing Compliance**: This agreement implements a 4% royalty rate based on the Ai-First Group Transfer Pricing Policy. Before execution, obtain a benchmarking study from a transfer pricing specialist (Big 4 or boutique firm) to support the arm's-length nature of this rate.

2. **IRS Form 926**: Upon execution, Licensee (Ai-First Inc.) must file IRS Form 926 (Return by a U.S. Transferor of Property to a Foreign Corporation) if any IP is being transferred to Cayman Holdings. Consult with U.S. tax counsel.

3. **Withholding Tax**: Review U.S.-Cayman tax treatment. Cayman Islands is not covered by a U.S. tax treaty, so 30% withholding may apply to royalty payments unless an exemption is available. Consider structuring to minimize withholding.

4. **IRC §482 Penalty Protection**: To obtain penalty protection under IRC §6662, prepare contemporaneous documentation before the due date of the U.S. tax return, including functional analysis and benchmarking study.

5. **Cayman Economic Substance**: Ensure Cayman Holdings has adequate substance (board meetings, decision-making, employees/service provider in Cayman) to support its role as IP owner and licensor.

6. **State Tax**: Consult with state tax counsel regarding nexus and apportionment issues for states where Licensee operates.
