## Why You're Reading This

Welcome to AI First. Before you dive into your role, I want you to understand *how* we work here. Not the org chart. Not the process docs. But the **philosophy**.

This is a real story about how I used AI to solve a personal problem. It demonstrates:

1. **How to partner with AI** (not command it, not fear it)
2. **The kind of work we expect from you** (strategic thinking, judgment, context)
3. **What AI handles** (execution, thoroughness, comprehensive follow-through)
4. **Why this matters** (you'll be more productive and happier)

## The Story

## Key Takeaways for New Hires

### 1. Your Job is Strategy + Judgment, Not Execution

In the story, notice what I did vs. what AI did:

**My contributions:**
- Vision ("life as code")
- Constraints ("I have ADHD, I work late")
- Decisions ("use home folder, not Documents")
- Course corrections ("change backups to 4 AM")

**AI's contributions:**
- Systems design
- Script creation
- Comprehensive updates (all 12 file references)
- Testing and verification

**This is how you'll work here.** You won't be writing bash scripts or updating config files by hand. You'll be thinking about *what* we should build and *why*.

### 2. AI Needs Your Context

Claude designed the system for my ADHD because I told it. It scheduled backups at 4 AM because I said I work late. It chose incremental migration because it understood my constraints.

**At AI First, you'll provide context:**
- Customer needs you understand
- Domain expertise you have
- Constraints that matter
- Trade-offs you see

AI can't do this. Only you can.

### 3. Iteration is Expected, Not Failure

I changed the backup schedule. I moved folders after we started. I added git to the system folder mid-stream.

**These weren't mistakes. They were iterations.**

AI partners don't get frustrated by change. They adapt. So should you. We value:
- Learning as we go
- Adjusting course when we learn more
- Continuous improvement

### 4. The Bar for Thoroughness is Higher

When I said "move the system folder," AI updated:
- Script paths
- Documentation
- Config files
- Agents
- Cross-references

**This is the new standard.** With AI, you don't get to say "I forgot to update the docs." AI won't forget. Neither should you.

### 5. You're Being Augmented, Not Replaced

I didn't become a DevOps engineer. I didn't learn rsync syntax or launchd configuration.

**I got a working system anyway.**

Your expertise is safe. Your value is **multiplied** by AI, not replaced by it.

## How This Applies to Your Role

Regardless of your role at AI First—engineering, product, sales, operations—this is how you'll work:

1. **Identify problems** worth solving
2. **Provide context** AI can't have
3. **Make judgment calls** AI can't make
4. **Let AI execute** with thoroughness you can't sustain
5. **Iterate** based on results

## Questions to Reflect On

As you read the full story, think about:

1. What problems in *your* work are like my file organization chaos?
2. Where do you spend time on execution vs. strategy?
3. What context do you have that AI doesn't?
4. How could AI augment your specific role?

## Next Steps

1. **Read the full story**: [Life as Code: My Story of Partnership with AI](../../examples/case_studies/life-as-code-story.md)
2. **Try it yourself**: Ask your manager for a "partnership project" where you solve a real problem with AI
3. **Share your experience**: We want to hear how it went

## Discussion Questions (for your onboarding 1:1)

- What surprised you about how Travis and Claude worked together?
- What would you have done differently?
- How does this change your expectations about working here?
- What's one area of your job you'd like AI to help with?
