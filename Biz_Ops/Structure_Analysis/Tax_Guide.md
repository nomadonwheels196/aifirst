The Ai‑First Incorporation & Tax Guide

1. Why This Guide Exists

You’re an engineer (or designer, or coffee‑powered dreamer) building Ai‑First.  You’ve written code, signed founder docs and day‑dreamed about unicorn exits, but when you open a spreadsheet full of tax acronyms your eyes glaze over.  This guide breaks down the messy world of equity compensation and exit taxes into digestible pieces.  We’ll define jargon, illustrate concepts with examples, and connect it all back to your own numbers from the Ai First Financial sheet.  By the end you’ll have a mental map of what happens when shares are granted, vest, exercised and ultimately sold.

Grab a drink, lean back and let’s turn the intimidating tax talk into something a little more like storytelling (with numbers).  Buckle up, because we’re going from “wait, what’s a grant date?” all the way to “how much do I actually take home when we sell this thing?”

2. Equity 101 — Key Terms You’ll Hear A Lot

Before we get lost in rates and regulations, let’s demystify some foundational vocabulary.  You’ll see these terms in founder agreements, option grant notices and investor decks.  Understanding them now will make everything later feel less like a foreign language.

Grant and Grant Date

Grant: When a company promises you equity — restricted stock, options or RSUs — it’s called a grant.  Think of it like being handed a golden ticket that can grow into real value once conditions (like time or performance) are met.

Grant date: The day your board of directors officially approves your equity award.  This date starts the clock for many tax rules (including the 30‑day window for filing a Section 83(b) election for restricted stock).

Vesting

Vesting is like a drip‑feed of ownership.  Instead of getting all your shares up front, you earn them over time or upon hitting milestones.  If you leave the company before everything vests, unvested shares or options typically go back to the company.

Exercise and Exercise Price

Exercise: Using the option to buy your shares.  Until you exercise, an option is simply the right to buy, not actual ownership.  For RSUs (restricted stock units), there’s no exercise — they just convert into shares automatically when they vest.

Exercise price (strike price): The price you must pay per share when you exercise an option.  It’s usually set at the fair market value (FMV) of the shares on the grant date.

Accelerated Tax vs. “Wait‑and‑See”

When you receive restricted stock, the IRS normally taxes you when it vests.  But you can accelerate that tax by filing an 83(b) election — paying ordinary income tax on the FMV at grant instead of at vesting.  This is often smart when the shares are nearly worthless at grant because it locks in a low taxable value.  We’ll walk through an example soon.

RSUs vs. Stock Options
	•	RSUs (Restricted Stock Units) grant you a promise: once the vesting conditions are met, the company will deliver actual shares (or cash equivalent).  There’s no exercise price; the shares simply convert to you when they vest.  You owe tax on the FMV of the shares at the moment of vesting ￼.
	•	Options give you a right — not an obligation — to purchase shares at a fixed price.  You only own the shares if you exercise the option and pay the exercise price.  If the company’s value tanks, you can walk away (your right becomes worthless).  Options come in two flavors:
	•	Incentive Stock Options (ISOs): These are special under U.S. law — if you hold the shares long enough after exercise (two years from grant and one year from exercise), gains may be taxed at long‑term capital gains rates rather than ordinary income.  They can also trigger the Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) because the “spread” between the exercise price and FMV at exercise is treated differently for AMT purposes.
	•	Non‑qualified Stock Options (NSOs): Simpler and more common outside of senior U.S. employees.  You pay ordinary income tax on the spread (FMV − exercise price) at exercise.  Any further appreciation after exercise is taxed at capital gains rates when you sell.

Qualified vs. Non‑Qualified Options

Qualified options are another way of saying “ISOs” — they qualify for favorable tax treatment (long‑term capital gains) if you meet holding requirements.  Non‑qualified options (NSOs) don’t meet those requirements, so their gains are treated as ordinary income at exercise.

AMT (Alternative Minimum Tax)

AMT is a parallel tax system that ensures high‑income taxpayers pay at least a minimum amount of tax.  When you exercise ISOs, the difference between the FMV at exercise and your exercise price counts as “preference income” for AMT.  If you exercise a large number of ISOs, you might owe AMT even before you sell the shares.

Convert to Shares (Delivery)

For RSUs or phantom stock plans, “delivery” means the company actually hands over shares (or cash equivalent) to you.  It’s the moment your account shows stock instead of IOUs.  For tax purposes, this is the vesting date for RSUs.

Arm’s‑Length Transaction

An arm’s‑length transaction is a deal between two unrelated, willing parties, each acting in their own best interest.  It’s the basis for determining the fair market value (FMV) of private company shares when there’s no public stock price.  Portuguese tax rules, for example, use the price “that would have been agreed between two independent parties” as the FMV ￼.

Foreign‑Sourced Income

Income that originates from outside your country of residence.  Under Portugal’s Non‑Habitual Resident (NHR) regime, foreign‑sourced dividends and capital gains can be exempt from Portuguese tax if they’re taxed in the source country ￼.

Dividends, Passive Royalties and Non‑Trading Income

Dividends: Profit distributions by a company to its shareholders.  Dividends can be taxed when paid out — at corporate level, personal level or both — depending on the jurisdictions involved.

Passive royalties: Income generated from intellectual property (IP) licensing.  If your IP sits in a low‑tax country and is licensed to operating companies, royalties flow up to the IP entity.  Different countries tax royalties at different rates (e.g., Ireland taxes passive income at 25 % while trading income is 12.5 %).

Non‑trading income: Income not derived from active trading/operations — for example, interest, dividends, or royalties — often taxed differently than operating profits.

Asset Sale vs. Share (Stock) Sale

When selling a business, the buyer can acquire either the assets (equipment, IP, contracts, etc.) or the shares (ownership itself).
	•	Asset sale: The target company sells its assets to the buyer and then distributes the proceeds to shareholders.  The company may pay corporate taxes on any gain, and shareholders pay taxes on distributions.
	•	Share sale: The seller transfers ownership of the company by selling shares.  The company itself usually pays no tax on the transaction; shareholders recognize capital gains.  Many jurisdictions (including Delaware, Cayman, Ireland and Andorra) do not impose corporate tax on a straight share sale ￼.

3. How Equity Is Valued When There’s No Stock Price

Determining Fair Market Value (FMV)

For public companies, it’s easy: the FMV at vesting or exercise is simply the market price on the stock exchange.  But Ai‑First is private, so how do you know how much a share is worth?

U.S. rules: Private companies must follow general equity compensation valuation rules.  If there’s no readily ascertainable market value, they must use a reasonable valuation method — often a third‑party 409A appraisal — to determine FMV ￼.  This valuation sets the strike price for options and is the basis for taxable income on restricted stock/RSUs.

Portugal: There are no specific rules for valuing unlisted shares.  The fair value is defined as the price that two independent parties would agree on ￼.  For early‑stage startups, this is usually very low.  You may still want a formal valuation for credibility if you’re subject to Portuguese tax.

Section 83(b) Example — When Par Value Matters

Imagine Ai‑First issues 1,000,000 restricted shares to Travis at incorporation for a total price of $100 (par value $0.0001 per share).  The board determines the FMV at grant is $0.01 per share (still cheap).  Without an 83(b) election, Travis would owe ordinary income tax when those shares vest at their fair value on the vesting date.  If the value increases to $1.00 per share by the time of vesting, his taxable income would be $900,000 (1,000,000 shares × ($1.00 – $0.10 cost basis)) — a painful tax bill with no cash in hand.  By filing an 83(b) election, he pays tax on the $0.01 FMV upfront instead.

In fact, Cooley’s guide uses a very similar example: founders receive 100,000 shares worth $0.01 at grant, $1 at vesting and $5 at sale.  Filing an 83(b) election means they report $1,000 of ordinary income at grant, instead of $100,000 at vesting ￼.  This front‑loads a tiny tax bill and locks in long‑term capital gains on future appreciation.

4. Taxing Stock Compensation — U.S. vs. Portugal

4.1 United States

Tax at vesting or exercise:
	•	RSUs: You are taxed when the units vest and convert to shares.  The taxable income is the FMV of the shares on the vesting date ￼.
	•	Restricted Stock (no 83(b)): Taxed at vesting on the FMV of the stock.  The FMV is determined using a 409A valuation for private companies ￼.
	•	Options (NSOs): Taxed at exercise.  You pay ordinary income tax on the spread (FMV at exercise – exercise price) and payroll taxes.  If you hold the shares for more than a year after exercise, any further gain is taxed at capital gains rates.
	•	Options (ISOs): No tax at exercise for regular tax, but the spread counts for AMT.  If you sell within one year of exercise or within two years of grant, the option becomes a disqualifying disposition and the spread is taxed as ordinary income.

Worldwide taxation: U.S. citizens owe tax on worldwide income.  You’ll owe U.S. tax even if you live abroad or your company is offshore ￼.

4.2 Portugal

Portuguese tax law treats share options and RSUs differently than the U.S.:
	•	Grant & vesting: Employees are not taxable at grant or vesting ￼.  Tax arises when you exercise the option or when RSUs convert to shares (the delivery date).
	•	Taxable amount: The difference between the fair value of the shares at exercise and the exercise price is taxed as employment income ￼.  There’s no formal 409A process; you must use an arm’s‑length FMV ￼.
	•	Rates: Portugal’s progressive rates can reach 54.5 % ￼, though those moving under NHR (Non‑Habitual Resident) may get a flat 20 % rate on Portuguese‑sourced income and exemptions on foreign‑sourced dividends and capital gains ￼.
	•	Capital gains: Gains on selling shares after exercise are taxed at a flat 28 % unless you opt to include them in your progressive tax base ￼.

5. Putting It All Together — Tax Outcomes at Exit

Let’s apply these concepts to your Ai‑First scenarios.  You plan a big exit in 2029–2030 with a $1 B valuation.  Your fully diluted ownership is 13 %, so your pre‑tax proceeds would be $130 M.  Here’s how much you’d likely take home under each holding structure, considering both corporate and personal taxes.  We assume a straight share sale (no asset sale), and we ignore state taxes for simplicity.

5.1 Scenario A: Delaware C‑Corp with QSBS

Corporate tax: Delaware corporations pay no tax on the sale of shares ￼.  Operating profits are taxed at 21 %, but that’s before the exit.

Personal tax: If you convert your Cayman shares to Delaware stock and meet the QSBS (Qualified Small Business Stock) requirements (issue the stock before assets exceed $50 M and hold for ≥5 years), you may exclude 100 % of the capital gains ￼.  That means 0 % U.S. federal tax on up to $10 M of gains or 10× your basis ￼.  Above the cap, gains are taxed at long‑term capital gains rates (~23.8 %).

Example: $130 M × 0 % (QSBS) = $130 M net.  If some of the gain exceeds the QSBS cap, apply the 23.8 % rate to the excess.

5.2 Scenario B: Cayman HoldCo → Delaware Flip

Corporate tax: Cayman imposes no corporate income or capital gains taxes ￼.  Flipping into a Delaware C‑Corp before raising VC can convert your shares to QSBS, but if you sell before meeting the five‑year holding period, you’ll pay U.S. tax.

Personal tax: A U.S. citizen pays 23.8 % federal capital gains tax (20 % + 3.8 % NIIT) on worldwide gains ￼.  Cayman has no personal tax, but there’s no foreign tax credit.

Example: $130 M × (1 − 0.238) ≈ $99 M after federal tax.

5.3 Scenario C: Ireland HoldCo with Portugal NHR

Corporate tax: Under Ireland’s participation exemption, an Irish company can sell shares in its subsidiaries tax‑free if it holds ≥5 % for ≥12 months and the target is in an EU or treaty country and trading ￼.  No corporate tax at exit.

Personal tax: You’ll still owe U.S. federal capital gains (~23.8 %).  Under Portugal’s NHR 2.0, foreign‑sourced gains may be exempt only if they are taxed at source ￼.  Because Ireland doesn’t tax the gain at source, Portugal may treat it as untaxed and impose its own tax (up to 28 % or progressive rates).  For simplicity, we assume U.S. tax only.

Example: $130 M × (1 − 0.238) ≈ $99 M.

5.4 Scenario D: Dubai (UAE) HoldCo

Corporate tax: The UAE’s new federal corporate tax is 0 % on profits up to AED 375,000 and 9 % on profits above that ￼.  However, dividends and capital gains may be exempt under the participation exemption if you own ≥5 % of a subsidiary for ≥12 months and the subsidiary’s income is taxed at ≥9 % ￼.  We assume 0 % corporate tax on the share sale.

Personal tax: The UAE doesn’t impose personal income or capital gains tax ￼, but you still owe 23.8 % U.S. tax on the gain ￼.

Example: $130 M × (1 − 0.238) ≈ $99 M.

5.5 Scenario E: Andorra HoldCo

Corporate tax: Andorra’s holding company regime offers a 100 % exemption on dividends and capital gains if the HoldCo holds ≥5 % of the subsidiary for ≥1 year and the subsidiary is taxed at ≥10 % ￼.  Thus, the share sale is tax‑free at the corporate level.

Personal tax: Andorra taxes capital gains on company shares at 10 %, but there is no tax if you own less than 25 % or hold the shares for more than 10 years ￼.  You do own <25 %, so there’s no Andorran capital gains tax.  Still, as a U.S. citizen you owe 23.8 % U.S. tax ￼.

Example: $130 M × (1 − 0.238) ≈ $99 M.

6. Formulas and Worksheets

To help you play with your own numbers, here are some formulas you can adapt in your spreadsheet.  Replace the variables with actual rates from your chosen jurisdiction.
	1.	Pre‑tax proceeds:
Pre_tax = Exit_Valuation × Founder_Share
In your case: Pre_tax = $1,000,000,000 × 13 % = $130,000,000.
	2.	Corporate tax at exit (if any):
After_Corp = Pre_tax × (1 − Corporate_Tax_Rate)
For share sales in Cayman, Ireland and Andorra, this rate is 0 %.  For a U.S. asset sale, it could be up to 21 %.
	3.	Withholding/dividend tax (applies when profits are distributed up from OpCo to HoldCo or HoldCo to you):
After_Wh = After_Corp × (1 − Withholding_Tax_Rate)
	4.	Personal capital gains tax:
Net_To_You = After_Wh × (1 − Personal_CG_Tax_Rate)
Use 0 % if QSBS applies; otherwise 23.8 % for U.S. citizens.
	5.	Final net proceeds:
Net_To_You becomes your post‑tax cash from the exit.  Compare across scenarios.

7. Closing Thoughts

The world of equity compensation and international tax planning is messy, but that doesn’t mean you have to face it unarmed.  Start by understanding your own equity: how many shares you have, when they vest, and whether you should file an 83(b) election.  Work with your board to set a defensible fair market value — a 409A valuation in the U.S. or an arm’s‑length appraisal in Europe.  When thinking about your global structure, remember these key takeaways:
	1.	QSBS is gold — a U.S. C‑Corp with qualified stock can eliminate federal capital gains tax after five years ￼.  If you’re comfortable with a U.S. exit and investor expectations, this path maximizes your personal take.
	2.	Offshore doesn’t eliminate U.S. tax — Cayman, Dubai and Andorra are tax‑free locally, but you still owe U.S. tax on gains ￼.  They can, however, defer or reduce corporate tax on annual profits.
	3.	Residency matters — Portugal’s NHR regime can shield foreign‑source dividends and capital gains ￼, but only if the gains are taxed in the source country.  Andorra offers a low personal tax if you own less than 25 % ￼.  Wherever you move, make sure your exit plan aligns with local and U.S. tax rules.
	4.	Get professional help — There is no one‑size‑fits‑all answer.  Use this guide to ask smarter questions of tax advisors and lawyers.  They’ll help you fine‑tune valuations, choose the best holding jurisdiction and comply with ever‑changing regulations.

Now that you’ve got the vocabulary and formulas, you can approach your Ai‑First journey with eyes wide open.  There will still be paperwork, but at least you’ll understand why you’re signing it (and maybe even crack a smile when reading those acronyms).  Happy building — and may your cap table one day be the stuff of unicorn legends.
