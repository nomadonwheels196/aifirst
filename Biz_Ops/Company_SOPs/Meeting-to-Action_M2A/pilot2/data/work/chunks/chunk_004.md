No I mean with that I fundamentally agree because as you say you have all these tools and say hey Grave be creative be productive and people say Chachapiti was the nearest hotel and you're like okay that's just a Google search that's not AI okay.
00:23:26 Travis 
And that's where, you know, so like I said, my partner, well, so we built this framework. So I sort of classified people into zero through four, so I guess five levels of AI competency, you know, and he works with, you know, PhD students and people with doctorates and, I mean, scientists who are, you know, relatively technology forward. And he says, most of his class is level zero through one. And he's like, you know, even after a week with them, he gets them maybe to level two,
00:23:59 Travis 
right? You know, and it's like, okay, there's so much more that I think we could help people with. And, you know, and it's not just knowledge workers, right? You know, even if you're a mechanic, you know, if you're crawling around underneath a car, instead of, you know, getting up and going looking up, you know, a manual for, you know, Mercedes Benz Unimog to try to figure out, you know, where this wire goes and what it's connected to. If you just start to understand, you can talk to AI and say, hey, here's what I'm experiencing.
00:24:33 Travis 
Like, go look this up for me and help me troubleshoot, right? Everyone on earth is a potential client. right whether you're using ai to improve actually i'll give you a really good example so you know working you know with this breast cancer startup um uh we encourage people who just recently got diagnosed with breast cancer to chat with ai about how to share their diagnosis with their family, like that i mean that's that's a really difficult conversation because it's going to impact you know.
00:25:05 Travis 
your life people are scared they're going to have questions the best feedback we got was on that topic they were like i was amazed that an ai could give me good advice you know that it it understood a little bit about my situation and it gave me custom advice you know about how to talk to my daughter about it and how to talk to my husband and you know suggestions about how they can help me you know it's like most people wouldn't think of ai to do something like that you know they're using like exactly like you said or google replacement so.
00:25:35 Travis 
that's what i'm trying to build.
00:25:37 Speaker 3 
anyways. I know, it's interesting. I'm just thinking, but the USP would be that it's kind of agnostic to different products, because now Pitari does the same, right? Do a self-evaluation and then Pitari says, whatever, accountability, here's a podcast, how about business review, listen to it. Thanks.
00:25:59 Travis 
Yeah, right.
00:26:01 Speaker 3 
Okay.
00:26:03 Travis 
This is proactive. It's your co-pilot, your coach that's literally there every minute of every day that you're on your computer working, right? And Pitari doesn't look at what you do. Pitari takes the input you give it, processes it, and tries to give you a good guess or a good plan. Right. I, you know, fundamentally, and this is where some of the challenges are that we're trying to hash out, you know, but, you know, if I see every app that you open and, you know, the way that you write prompts, I mean, there's, you know, we have to be very careful with data privacy.
00:26:39 Travis 
And I think I have a plan for some of that or for most of it, actually. But, you know, we, you know, first, the first step is to earn people's trust because, you know, not everyone's going to want you to watch everything that they do. You know, one of the first guardrails we made a decision as a company on is, you know, are we willing to provide like unlimited visibility to companies about what their employees are doing? And the answer is no, you know, because we want people to feel secure and not like this.
00:27:16 Travis 
Right. So, you know, there's a lot of things to think about. But anyways, you're one of the smartest people that I worked with at Zscaler and, you know, knowing how everything's going there. But then again, it is a startup. I just wanted to see if.
00:27:34 Speaker 3 
you would have any interest. Well, the mission sounds great. I mean, there are lots of other things to consider, of course. But as mentioned, I think that's the right way forward. I had, a chat with a friend recently and I said, you know, what AI needs, it needs a trainer. Because sometimes it just has to tell me, Chris, do you really want me to ask me that? That's really something you should Google or figure out yourself in five seconds. In other words,
00:28:07 Speaker 3 
you're not using me right. And then what you're saying is exactly. And let's use AI to help me fix it.
00:28:18 Travis 
So, so I'll actually I can give you an example. I mean, literally, I'm just going to share my screen and what I'm working on right now. So, so, and I'll try to I'll try to sort of summarize this but so I, you know, I'm building agents within our company like folder structure, sort of. to where, you know, whenever somebody creates a new folder,
00:28:52 Travis 
so, you know, I just created like an accounting and finance folder to store expenses, okay. And so, you know, what I have is I'm running multiple agents, ChadGBT, Codex, Claude, Gemini, a bunch of other stuff. And so, I'm basically like going through as I'm building these things and saying, okay, you know, it creates this dot agents folder with the readme.
