Well, so let's go through some of your examples, right? Because this is how this started, is I literally just sat down next to people and I watched, what are they doing today? And I was like, there's so many better ways of doing something, right? So let's say you join a call, okay? So you go to a customer call and from that customer call, let's say that you go with one of your SEs. So you got a sales guy, an SE, and then you're there as well.
00:17:07 Travis 
From that one customer call, you may identify some coaching opportunity for your SE. You may identify some feature request or platform issue the customer brings up. You're going to gain information about where they're at in their sales process, the things that are important to them, okay? And then under normal circumstances, what would you do? sit down afterwards, you'd review your notes, you'd figure out like, well, you know, yeah,
00:17:38 Travis 
they have this problem with the platform, but I don't have time to deal with that and it's not gonna impact them buying anything. So I'm not gonna do anything with that. Maybe you remember to kind of mention, you know, the coaching thing, but, you know, you mentioned it once, you know, how do you follow up on it? Do you follow up on it? Maybe, maybe not, is this a pattern or was it a one-off thing, right? You know, you have all this information about, you know, the customer call in your notes, but the sales guy has some other notes and your SE has some more notes and so forth, right?
00:18:11 Travis 
What if you could, you know, whenever you see something like that happen, you say, okay, I recognize that I could be doing a better way of handling this, right? And so you sit down, you know, with whatever, ChadGBT or something that's approved, and you say, okay, I want you, you know, we're gonna develop a. an agent that every time I go to a call and I record the call, I want you to get that.
00:18:45 Travis 
transcript and I want you to analyze it for coaching opportunities, for customer problems, feature requests, and for customer or sales information, and I want you to automatically drop those into Markdown files, and then you have another agent that goes and pulls that and you have a coaching agent, and so from every meeting you go to, it goes and it looks in your coaching folder for the specific person and it says, okay, I'm going to collect all.
00:19:17 Travis 
of these coaching observations from all the different meetings, analyze those, and now I have a... you know something that says here's what this person is doing really well here's what you know where they could maybe improve and then if you say okay now give me a uh you know a a development plan, and then you integrate that into petari right and you take you but i mean you get where i'm going, like if people understood um you know how do i get to be much more efficient.
00:19:52 Travis 
I mean, that was the first example off the top of your head. I'm already doing that today, right? After my meetings, I look at a transcript if I'm recording it, and we're pulling feature requests, we're pulling examples, and all of that goes into the right repository. And then my product guy has an agent that reviews that and says, is this something that's already in our product roadmap?
00:20:22 Travis 
Yes, no. Anything that isn't, right, goes onto the list, and then he can obviously manually review that. But the more times, you know, every time a new feature request sort of comes up, you know, he knows, oh, another customer's asked for that, it moves up the priority list. So there's so many things that you can automate, but it's not, this is the problem. This is what I was saying. the business executives high up are not the people who know what really needs to be done but they're the ones who are cutting the checks for all this ai stuff it's the people who are on the ground day to.
00:20:54 Travis 
day that that know what needs to happen and that know how to improve their life to improve the business so if we enable the people we can help fix the business does that make sense yeah i'll.
00:21:09 Speaker 3 
just let me try to rephrase that to see if i so what i'm envisioning what i'm understanding is essentially it's a system of agents actually where you have the travis agents the chris agent and then you have the acme agent that sits in the back and is connected to all these little agents so that one the chris agent teaches chris the chris maybe it's a hierarchical thing there is a team chris agent that tells you chris here's your team here are the things that, I don't know.
00:21:39 Travis 
So I'm not necessarily trying to build all of those different things. That's just an example. What I'm trying to do, and again, in the long run, yes, there's probably a lot of other things that we could try to build. But instead, you know, what I'm trying to do is I'm trying to identify. So, you know, having this conversation with you, like this is the conversation that the agent would have. It would say, hey, you just got off of a Zoom meeting. You know, I noticed that they talked about, you know, product feature challenge.
00:22:13 Travis 
You know, you know, you just sent a Slack message to your teammate. You know, would you like for us to work together to build these these agents? Right. So we're not trying to build all of those things. Instead, we're trying to enable the human. to brainstorm ideas and to know enough about vibe coding or you know lovable or whatever you know there's a million tools out there that can do very similar things so we're all.
00:22:44 Travis 
about enabling the human to better interact with AI and to brainstorm on all these use cases and that's what I'm saying I don't want to create an agent to solve every problem I want to enable the people to be creative so that they can solve real problems and develop something they actually need to make their life better.
