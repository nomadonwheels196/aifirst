00:36:28 Speaker 3 
also fine not just um just a huge fan of whatsapp but uh so uh or let's see yeah if you have iphone.
00:36:39 Travis 
uh then there you see the chat so if you have iphone you can just pop in my email and use imessage.
00:36:51 Speaker 3 
It's the chat. I never used Google.
00:36:53 Travis 
Yeah, it was weird for me, too. Bottom right, there's, like, a little bubble next to the person.
00:37:05 Speaker 3 
Who is this? Is this a number from the States. 
00:37:08 Travis 
Yeah, my main WhatsApp number is the one from the States. And then my email I've had for freaking ever. Actually, it's kind of a point of pride for me because, like, they got rid of the Mac.com domain, basically, and, you know, moved to iCloud for everything. And so, like, if you ever run across somebody who has, you know, a Mac.com domain email, it's, you know, hands down,
00:37:40 Travis 
they're an old-school Mac person.
00:37:45 Speaker 3 
Yeah, no, I mean, I just phoned you.
00:37:48 Travis 
Okay, yeah, I got it. I'll send you a number.
00:37:52 Speaker 3 
Perfect. No, cool. I mean, let's definitely stay in touch. I'll definitely think about it. Sure. Okay. Any specific feedback you'd like? I mean, just so that I can structure it already in terms of other use cases.
00:38:06 Travis 
Yeah, I mean, I guess the best feedback that I'm really, I guess, kind of asking for everyone, you know, is look at how you use AI today and, you know, and say, okay, you know, if I had something like this, what would I want it to do? You know, and it's hard like this. And this is part of what we're running into is, you know, a lot of people I talk to actually.
00:38:38 Travis 
So one of my first employees, lover to death. She's a lawyer by by trade. Right. You know, I'm bringing her on as chief of staff or whatever. And, you know, and she said the other day, she was like, you know, she's like, I, you know, yeah, I can make parts of my life better. And I mean, and she's working here, like she believes in our mission. But she's like, I was never going to sign, the medical release for my kids, you know, for their school. And I said, why won't it?
00:39:09 Travis 
And she's like, well, not in our lifetime it won't. And so I walked her through exactly how it could do that. And she and she had never even thought of, you know, that as a potential use case. And so it's like it's kind of the yeah, I mean, it's a transformation mindset sort of thing. And so asking people to think of the use, cases that you wish you had help with is really kind of hard because.
00:39:40 Travis 
you know, most people don't even know the right questions to ask when we get, started, and that's why a lot of what we're going to have to do early on is is, just start giving people good examples. And once once they see certain things, working, you know, I think your brain start to bring chemistry changes a little bit. Right. And that's honestly like one of my first use cases was my dad. Right. You're frozen. Let me hear you. Thank you for watching!
00:40:11 Travis 
oh okay there we go sorry my camera maybe close me yeah one of my first you know, examples was my dad you know my dad's like 75 years old thought ai was going to be the end of the world and you know within an hour or two of working with him he he was like travis you have completely changed the way i mean he's still working right but he's like you've completely changed the way i do business um you know like that's our goal is to to help people see so much.
00:40:45 Travis 
value you know that that they're like yeah i understand this now i know at least how to get started um you know and then it's a journey after that right so that's the journey.
00:40:57 Speaker 3 
I mean, I see, you know, B2C, I already see lawyers, like, who the fuck knows what they are talking about, or we want to buy a house, someone has to sign off on it, and I have to pay him 10,000 euros so that he reads me a text and says, yeah, you understood it. That's like the first.
00:41:13 Travis 
thing. I've already got a law firm, actually, so when I was consulting with a law firm about helping us to incorporate, he was like, can I sign up to work with you guys? Like, literally, almost everyone I've talked to are like, you know, where do I sign up? And I'm like, well, you know, we're still developing the product, but yes, you know, you can be a design partner. You're spot on. I mean, I built... So, you know, we're trying to, I'm trying to figure it out, finalize it right now, but we're going to, I think, incorporate in the Cayman Islands with a subsidiary in the US and in Europe. And so there's all like inner company, IP transfer paperwork, and there's all kinds of stuff. I built it all in a weekend. And I asked, you know, like, how much would a consulting firm or a law firm, an accountant firm, you know, charge me for all this?
00:42:09 Travis 
It came back and said somewhere between $70,000 and $100,000 to build all that paperwork. And I built it by myself in a weekend. Now, I'm going to have a lawyer review it, you know, but paying them for a couple of hours, you know, at $600 an hour to review something is not $100,000. So, you know, yes, you're spot on. Like, you know, once people start seeing how, you know, what they could do with this, it's amazing.
00:42:40 Travis 
I think there's a great business here.
00:42:42 Speaker 3 
Yeah, I mean, I will definitely have some other questions later on, like what kind of role would you have in mind, but I think that's step two. Yeah. Or three, whatever. No, cool. Let me think about it. I'll definitely come back to you on that.
00:43:01 Travis 
Awesome, man. Well, enjoy your weekend. And yeah, just just shoot me a message next week whenever you have some time to chat. This is my full time right now. So, you know, I have a lot on my plate, but most of it's flexible.
00:43:15 Speaker 3
