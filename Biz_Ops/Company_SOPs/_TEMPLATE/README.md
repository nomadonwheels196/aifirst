# SOP Template

## How to Use
1. Copy this `_TEMPLATE` folder to a new folder within `Company_SOPs/` (or a department’s `SOPs/`).
2. Rename the folder to the SOP name (concise, descriptive).
3. Complete `PROCESS_SPEC.md` and `process_runbook.md`.
4. Populate `.ai/` only with non‑secret prompts/config/scripts.
5. Submit changes for review and maintain a review cadence.

## Required Files
- `PROCESS_SPEC.md` — authoritative specification for this SOP.
- `process_runbook.md` — practical, stepwise runbook for operators.
- `.ai/README.md` — what automation exists and how to operate it.
- `README.md` — short overview and links to the above.

## Review Cadence
- Owner maintains a published review cadence (e.g., quarterly) and logs material changes in Change Control.
