# Automation (.ai/) Guidance

## What belongs
- Prompts, small config files, helper scripts to assist with the SOP.

## What must not
- No secrets, tokens, credentials, or large artifacts. Keep large files out of git.

## Run & Operate
- Execute from repo root; prefer logged, reviewable scripts.
- Enable human review for high‑risk actions; follow repo `AGENTS.md`.
