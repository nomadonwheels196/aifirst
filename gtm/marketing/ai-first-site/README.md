# Ai‑First Static Website

A minimal, future‑proof static site inspired by the clean, typographic aesthetic seen on open.com‑style sites, built with semantic HTML + Pico.css (no build step).

## Run with Docker

```bash
cd ai-first-site
docker compose up -d
```

Open http://<NAS-IP>:8080/.

## Customize

Edit files in `site/`. No build process required.
