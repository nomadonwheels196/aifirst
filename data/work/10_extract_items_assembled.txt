Thinking...
We have a short transcript. It seems nothing actionable. The instruction: Extract summary, actions, decisions, risks, evidence. But transcript has minimal content: "Nice. No, then I'll definitely do that. So thanks a lot for reaching out and thinking of me. It was super interesting talk. 00:43:25 Travis It was. I'm looking forward to your feedback later. Have a good one. Talk to you later. You too. Cheers. 00:43:58 Speaker 1 Bye."

We need to produce JSON with keys summary, actions, decisions, risks, evidence. Possibly empty lists? But we need to include evidence. There's no actual actions or decisions or risks. So actions, decisions, risks can be empty arrays. Evidence may include quotes from transcript. But instructions: evidence: list of evidence objects each with id, quote, timestamp, speaker_id. We can provide at least one evidence for summary? But summary is just a string. But we might not need evidence for summary. But evidence must list all extracted evidence? The spec: "extractive evidence (quote + timestamp + speaker_id)" for each action, decision, risk. But we might not have any. So we can provide empty evidence list.

But there might be evidence for summary? The spec does not say evidence list must include summary evidence. So we can leave evidence empty.

But we must not add any other keys. So produce JSON with summary (maybe empty string?), actions empty list, decisions empty list, risks empty list, evidence empty list.

But maybe summary should mention the conversation: "Conversation about follow-up, no actions." Let's provide summary: "Participants briefly exchanged pleasantries and plan to provide feedback later." Provide evidence? Not necessary.

But we could still add evidence for quote "I'm looking forward to your feedback later" as a timestamp 00:43:25, speaker Travis. That could be evidence for the summary? But not required. Could be included anyway. But spec says evidence list is separate, not tied to summary. But we can still include evidence if we want. But risk: If we include evidence, we must reference it in actions, decisions, risks? But there are no actions, decisions, risks, so evidence can stand alone. The spec didn't forbid evidence alone.

Thus produce JSON: summary string, empty lists, evidence with at least one entry.

Ok. Provide.

Ensure JSON is valid.
...done thinking.
