# Boundaries and Gaurdrails

**Version:** v1.0

**Owner:** Travis Sheppard

## What We Won’t Do

- Replace human creativity or decision-making
- Build another Ai chatbot platform
- Sell fear-based “Ai risk” narratives
- Optimize vanity metrics over impact
- Build hype instead of value

## Strategic Guardrails

- First we integrate into current workflows for maximum buy-in and quick impact
- Then we empower people to redefine and transform those workflows with Ai
- Transformation is not about forcing tool change. It’s about evolving how people think and work, then letting workflows and tools follow
- We measure **real user outcomes**
- We stay true to our mission of **human empowerment**
