## Core Engine: Ai First Framework

A closed-loop system that mirrors how people actually grow and learn at work — designed to solve the two biggest barriers to AI transformation: **adoption** and **competency**.

1. **Shadow** – Observe and map how people work across tools and contexts.
2. **Assess** – Measure each individual’s current level of AI adoption and competency within their existing workflows. We also assess company strategy, challenges, AI initiatives, approved tools, and the individual’s role — all as inputs to their personalized plan.
3. **Plan** – Build a tailored roadmap for each person that maximizes their productivity and business impact through smarter AI utilization.
4. **Demonstrate Value** – To increase adoption, we earn trust first. Based on each person’s motivations, we recommend targeted use cases, workflow improvements, and automations aligned with their goals and responsibilities. By quantifying time saved, quality improved, and creativity unlocked, we trigger the “lightbulb moments” that drive lasting adoption.
5. **Enable** – Deliver step-by-step, in-workflow coaching and support so users can learn by doing, not by training.
6. **Iterate** – Continuously learn from user data and refine both individual plans and the broader organizational model over time.

This cycle transforms both people and performance — **raising AI fluency, embedding adoption into daily work, and creating measurable, compounding ROI**.
