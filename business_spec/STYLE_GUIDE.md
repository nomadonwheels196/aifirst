# Business Spec Style Guide

**Quick Reference for All Agents and Writers**

## Company Name and Capitalization (MANDATORY)

### Company Name
✅ **Always:** "Ai First" (capital A, lowercase i, capital F, no hyphen)
❌ **Never:** "AI First", "Ai-First", "AiFirst"

### Ai vs AI Capitalization

| Context | Use | Examples |
|---------|-----|----------|
| **Company/Product (Positive)** | **Ai** (lowercase i) | Ai First, Ai coach, Ai adoption, Ai initiatives, human-Ai productivity, Ai capability, Ai fluency |
| **Industry Problems (Negative)** | **AI** (uppercase I) | AI transformation (failing), AI training (doesn't work), AI experiments (fragmented), AI noise, AI risk, shadow AI |

### When in Doubt

Ask yourself: "Is this about **our solution** or **the industry problem**?"
- **Our solution** → Ai (lowercase i)
- **Industry problem** → AI (uppercase I)

---

## Common Phrases

### Correct ✅
- "Ai First is the operating system for human-Ai productivity"
- "Most AI transformation efforts fail"
- "Employees are overwhelmed by AI training"
- "Ai First closes the Ai competency gap"
- "shadow AI is growing faster than sanctioned adoption"
- "Your personal Ai coach"
- "Ai adoption and competency"

### Incorrect ❌
- "AI First is the operating system..." (wrong company name)
- "Ai-First approach" (wrong hyphenation)
- "Most Ai transformation efforts fail" (should be "AI" for problem)
- "AI coach" when referring to our product (should be "Ai coach")
- "Ai training that doesn't work" (should be "AI training" for the problem)

## Tagline & Key Phrases

**Official tagline:**
> Your personal Ai coach — empowering your people to build the future of work from the inside out.

**Official positioning:**
> Ai First is the operating system for human-Ai productivity.

**Key value statement:**
> Ai First turns Ai from a tech initiative into a company-wide capability.

---

## Why This Matters

This intentional capitalization creates brand distinction:

1. **"Ai" (lowercase)** = Human-centered, accessible, empowering technology (our brand)
2. **"AI" (uppercase)** = Impersonal, failing, status quo (the problem we solve)

This subtle difference reinforces our positioning as the human-first alternative to traditional AI approaches.

- **Metrics:** ROI, ARR, PMF (uppercase acronyms, define on first use)
- **Integration platforms:** M365, ServiceNow, Salesforce, Slack, Notion, Google Workspace

### Formatting
- Use **bold** for emphasis on key terms (sparingly)

- Use quotes for industry terms: "shadow AI", "AI training"
- Use > for blockquotes/key messages
