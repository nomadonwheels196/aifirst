# Core Customers

**Version:** v1.0

**Owner:** Travis Sheppard

## Initial Target

We start with **large enterprises** (B2B) because:
- They have the biggest productivity and transformation potential
- They already invest in Ai but lack adoption
- ROI from Ai adoption can be measured at a **workflow + business level**

## Expansion Path (Market Sequencing)

1. **Enterprise** – Ai workforce transformation platform
2. **Mid-Market / SMB** – scaled self-serve version
3. **Consumer (B2C)** – personal Ai coach for careers and capability

## Personas

| Role | Need |
| --- | --- |
| CIO | Responsible Ai adoption & governance |
| COO | Productivity and workflow transformation |
| CHRO | Workforce capability development |
| CTO | Reduced tech friction |
| Ai/Innovation Leaders | Real adoption wins |
