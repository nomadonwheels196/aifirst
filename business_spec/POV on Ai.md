## Our Philosophy

Ai is not here to replace humans. Ai is here to **extend human potential**.  

## Core Beliefs

- Ai should **augment human ability**
- Ai is **behavioral**, not just technical
- Ai must be **accessible to all**
- Value doesn’t come from building more – it comes from using better
- Adoption and conversation are the real multipliers
- Ai is a **tool**, not a god or a threat
- Humans decide **what and why** — Ai helps with **how**
