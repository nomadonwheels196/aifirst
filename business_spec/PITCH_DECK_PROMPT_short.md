## Alternative Shorter Prompt (For Quick Generation)

```
Create a 12-slide enterprise sales deck for Ai First, a behavioral change platform solving the AI adoption crisis.

**Audience:** C-suite executives at enterprises with failed AI initiatives
**Goal:** Secure pilot deals by showing measurable ROI through behavior change

**Narrative Flow:**
1. The Crisis: Billions invested in AI, outcomes remain flat
2. Why it fails: Top-down, tool-first approaches ignore adoption
3. Our Solution: Operating system for human-Ai productivity (behavioral change platform)
4. The Framework: 6-step closed loop (Shadow→Assess→Plan→Demonstrate→Enable→Iterate)
5. Outcomes: 7 measurable benefits including productivity, adoption, innovation, ROI visibility
6. Differentiation: Real-time coaching vs training, bottom-up vs top-down
7. Hidden Value: Demand intelligence—see what your people actually need
8. C-Suite Value: Show specific value for CEO, CIO, COO, CHRO, CTO, Innovation Leaders
9. The Result: Self-sustaining ecosystem where people, Ai, business evolve together
10. Philosophy: Human-centered—Ai extends potential, doesn't replace
11. Integration: Works in M365, ServiceNow, Salesforce, Slack, Notion, Google Workspace
12. CTA: "Stop chasing models. Start empowering your people."

**Design:** Modern, professional, minimal text, clean data visualizations, NO generic AI imagery. Focus on authentic workplace visuals and business outcomes.

**Tone:** Executive-level, confident, data-driven, inspirational but grounded.

**Key Message:** "Your personal Ai coach—empowering your people to build the future of work from the inside out."

## Pro Tips for Best Results

### For Gamma.app:
1. **Start with outline approval**: Paste the full prompt, generate outline, review and adjust BEFORE generating slides
2. **Lock your brand theme**: Apply your workspace theme before generation if available
3. **Use constraints**: The slide count and bullet limits help prevent bloat
4. **Iterate in stages**: Generate → review → refine specific slides rather than regenerating everything

### For slidedecks.ai (SlidesGPT):
1. **Use the full detailed prompt**: More detail = better results
2. **Review in browser first**: Check the flow before purchasing/downloading
3. **Export format**: Choose PowerPoint or Google Slides based on your needs
4. **Text-to-presentation option**: You can also paste the entire customer_story.md as plain text

### For Both Platforms:
1. **Specify what to avoid**: The "NO generic AI imagery" instruction is critical
2. **Request specific visuals**: Clean bar charts, flow diagrams, comparison tables work best
3. **Keep text minimal**: Let visuals carry the story
4. **Test the narrative flow**: Read through as if presenting—does it build logically?

### After Generation:
1. **Customize contact slide**: Add your actual contact information
2. **Add real data/metrics**: Replace placeholder numbers with actual ROI projections
3. **Insert authentic imagery**: Replace any stock photos with real workplace/product screenshots
4. **Practice the pitch**: Ensure the deck supports a 10-15 minute verbal presentation

## Naming Convention Reminder

When the AI generates the deck, verify that it maintains the correct capitalization:
- ✅ "Ai First" (company name)
- ✅ "Ai" when referring to our solution/positive context
- ✅ "AI" when referring to industry problems/negative context

If the AI uses incorrect capitalization, provide this feedback: "Please update all instances to use 'Ai First' (capital A, lowercase i) for the company name, and 'Ai' (lowercase i) when referring to our technology/solution in positive contexts."
