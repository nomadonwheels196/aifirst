# Ai First – Core Company Spec

**Version:** v1.1

**Status:** Draft

**Owner:** Travis Sheppard

**Last Updated:** 2025-11-12

## Purpose

The Core Company Spec defines how Ai First operates, why we, as an organization, exist, and what success means.

It is the **single source of truth** that aligns mission, product, culture, and execution.

This specification:
- Clarifies **what we are building and why**
- Aligns **teams and decisions**
- Defines **how we prioritize work**
- Acts as a **contract of intent** for anyone who joins the company
- Scales decision-making without bureaucracy

This spec is a **living document** and will evolve as the company grows.

## How to Use This Spec

- Every major decision should map back to this spec
- If something is unclear or changed by reality, we update the spec
- If a proposal or initiative **cannot be justified through the Business Spec**, it should not move forward
- This spec ensures that **clarity replaces politics** and **purpose replaces noise**
