# Overview

# Ai  First – Core Company Spec

**Version:** v1.0

**Status:** Draft

**Owner:** Travis Sheppard

**Last Updated:** 2025-10-17

## Purpose

The Core Company Spec defines how Ai First operates, why it exists, and what success means.

It is the **single source of truth** that aligns mission, product, culture, and execution.

This specification:
- Clarifies **what we are building and why**
- Aligns **teams and decisions**
- Defines **how we prioritize work**
- Acts as a **contract of intent** for anyone who joins the company
- Scales decision-making without bureaucracy

This spec is a **living document** and will evolve as the company grows.

## How to Use This Spec

- Every major decision should map back to this spec
- If something is unclear or changed by reality, we update the spec
- If a proposal or initiative **cannot be justified through the Core Spec**, it should not move forward
- This spec ensures that **clarity replaces politics** and **purpose replaces noise**

## Structure

This Core Spec is modular. Each section lives in its own document:

| File | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `mission.md` | Our purpose and long-term intent |
| `problem.md` | The problem we exist to solve |
| `customers.md` | Who we serve and why |
| `value-proposition.md` | How we create value |
| `product-strategy.md` | What we are building |
| `operating-principles.md` | How we operate |
| `success-metrics.md` | Definition of success |
| `boundaries.md` | What we won’t do |
| `pov-on-ai.md` | Our philosophy on Ai  |
