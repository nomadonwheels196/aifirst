## Operating Principles

1. If you learn something new that other people need to know, add it to the [Capability Repository](https://www.notion.so/29afd07ed1c28025b6e2fddd46663d81?pvs=21)
2. Leaders are responsible for communicating strategy to their teams, soliciting feedback, and aggregating feedback to leadership.  Everyone should know how they and their work contribute to the company strategy
3. We always use the most efficient way of doing what we need for the business, even if it takes more time up front
