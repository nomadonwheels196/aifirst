## Operating Principles

### **1.  Clarity Through Documentation**

- Every decision, issue, or lesson is written down.
- Decision Memos: *context → options → rationale → owner → outcome.*
- Notion is the single source of truth; if it isn’t documented, it doesn’t exist.
- If you learn something new that other people need to know, add it to the [Capability Repository](https://www.notion.so/29afd07ed1c28025b6e2fddd46663d81?pvs=21)

### 2. Communication & Feedback

Leaders are responsible for communicating strategy to their teams, soliciting feedback, and aggregating feedback to leadership.  Everyone should know how they and their work contribute to the company strategy.

### 3. Operate on Principles and Reflection

- **Embrace reality & learn from failure:** Pain+reflection = progress
- *We iterate: set clear goals, identify obstacles, diagnose root-causes, design responses, execute and repeat*
- We always use the most efficient way of doing what we need for the business, even if it takes more time up front
