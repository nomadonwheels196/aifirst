# Case Studies

## Purpose
Curate referenceable customer stories that demonstrate value (problem → solution → results) for use in sales cycles, marketing, and investor updates.

## Structure & Conventions
- Format: Markdown files per story. Suggested filename: `company-or-usecase-slug.md`.
- Required sections: Summary, Customer/Use Case, Problem, Solution, Results (metrics), Quote(s), Assets/Links, Approvals.
- Data: include concrete KPIs (e.g., time saved, cost reduction, revenue lift). Avoid unverifiable claims.
- Example: `life-as-code-customer-story.md:1` (see this as a content/style reference).

## Workflow
- Draft by Sales/PMM → Internal review → Customer approval → Publish (website/one-pager).
- Legal review required when quoting logos, names, or sensitive metrics.

## Owners
- DRI: PMM or Sales Enablement
- Review cadence: quarterly content audit

## Security & Privacy
- Do not include PII. Use customer names/logos only with approval.
- Maintain a private draft if approvals are pending; publish only after sign-off.

## Related
- Website placement: `Marketing/AI_First_Site/Site/Sales/README.md:1`
- Sales usage: link in sequences, proposals, and ROI decks.

## Contributing
- Keep stories concise, evidence-based, and skimmable.
- Add source links (analytics, before/after screenshots) where possible.
