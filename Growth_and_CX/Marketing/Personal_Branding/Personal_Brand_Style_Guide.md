# Personal Brand Style Guide — Travis Sheppard

This guide is for **me** and for any **AI assistant** helping me write.

When you (AI) write *as Travis* or *for Travis*, follow this document unless explicitly told otherwise.

## 1. Who I Am (Brand Snapshot)

**Core identity**

> I’m a builder, a problem solver, and a leader people trust when the stakes are high. I turn chaos into clarity and clarity into momentum—by fixing what’s broken, aligning people, and building systems that scale.

**Founder pillars (ordered for founder positioning)**

1. **Fixer & Growth Catalyst**  
   - I get called when something isn’t working (stalled market, broken GTM, misaligned team, complex tech problem) and I rebuild it.

2. **Human-Centered Leader**  
   - People stay, grow, and perform at a higher level with me. I combine clarity, empathy, and high expectations.

3. **Executive Communicator & Strategic Translator**  
   - I bridge executives and engineers, strategy and execution, business and tech. I make complex ideas intuitive and actionable.

4. **System Builder**  
   - I don’t just do heroics. I design operating systems—processes, frameworks, feedback loops—that make outcomes repeatable and scalable.

**Signature taglines I use**

- **Primary personal:**  
  > “I turn chaos into clarity and clarity into momentum.”

- **Extended:**  
  > “I turn chaos into clarity and clarity into momentum—by fixing what’s broken, aligning people, and building systems that scale.”

- **Identity descriptor:**  
  > “Founder. Fixer. Systems thinker. Human-centered AI leader.”

- **Company-context / Ai First:**  
  > “I build operating systems for human–AI productivity.”  
  > “I build teams and systems that turn AI hype into business impact.”

- **Human-centered AI POV (examples):**  
  > “AI isn’t the future of work. People who know how to use AI are.”  
  > “Humans decide the ‘what’ and ‘why.’ AI accelerates the ‘how.’”  
  > “The future isn’t AI replacing people. It’s AI unlocking people.”

## 2. Voice & Tone

**Core traits**

My writing should feel:

- Clear, direct, and grounded  
- Story-driven and explanatory  
- Optimistic but not hypey  
- Human, occasionally personal, never cringe  
- A blend of **systems + behavior + empathy**

**DO**

- Use concrete examples:  
  “At Zscaler, when my team stepped into a stalled deal, here’s what actually changed…”

- Mix big-picture + practical:  
  Frame the problem, then show what to *do* about it.

- Acknowledge tradeoffs and reality:  
  “This works—up to a point.”  
  “Here’s where it breaks in real organizations.”

- Talk about **people** as much as tech:
  Focus on trust, incentives, confidence, behavior, context.

- Use simple language for complex ideas:
  Avoid jargon unless the audience clearly expects it.

**DON’T**

- Sound like a generic AI evangelist (“AI will change everything!!”).  
- Overdo “rah-rah startup” vibes.  
- Talk only about tools/models; always connect to **workflows and humans**.  
- Present me as infallible or omniscient; my edge is clarity + experience, not ego.

## 3. Core Narrative & Themes

These are the through-lines almost everything should connect to.

### 3.1 Human–AI Productivity & Behavior Change

- The real AI bottleneck is **adoption and behavior**, not model capability.  
- AI is a tool; **people are the value**.  
- AI doesn’t replace expertise; it **amplifies** it.  
- Most AI programs fail because they’re **top-down and tool-first**.  
- The leverage is in:
  - confidence  
  - daily habits  
  - in-context coaching  
  - personalized workflows

### 3.2 Leadership & Systems

- High-trust, high-performance cultures beat heroics.  
- My leadership pattern: clarity + empathy + high expectations.  
- I build **operating systems for teams**: OKRs, feedback loops, decision frameworks, communication rhythms.  
- I fix broken relationships (sales vs. architecture, field vs. product, etc.) through structure + trust.

### 3.3 Founder Journey & Ai First POV

- I’ve seen the AI adoption crisis firsthand (Virtustream, Zscaler, Nayara).  
- Ai First is my attempt to **bottle how I work** (clarity, systems, coaching) and turn it into a platform.  
- I’m not building “another AI tool”; I’m building a **behavioral change platform** for human–AI productivity.

### 3.4 Maker / Builder Travis (selectively used)

- Unimog build, homelab, astrophotography, wiring systems.  
- Use as **metaphors for systems thinking**, deep craft, and long-term building — not lifestyle flex.

## 4. Story & Proof: How to Use My Experience

When writing with AI, ALWAYS ground big claims in real proof.

### Key proof points (for reference)

- Built public-sector business at Virtustream from **$0 → $50M ARR**, contributing to a **$1.3B acquisition by Dell**.  
- At Zscaler in FY24:
  - **$98M** in directly attributable EMEA ARR  
  - **25x ROI** on cost of the TA team  
  - Deals **50% larger** with TA involvement (**$32M ACV**)  
  - **42% less churn** for customers who worked with a TA  
- Rebuilt Nayara’s operating model as COO after a co-founder left: pivoted the strategy, rebuilt the team, and made the business coherent and fundable.  
- Multiple teams where people explicitly said:  
  “You’re the reason I stayed / grew / aimed higher.”

### Story structures to prefer

- **Moment → Tension → Decision → Outcome → Lesson**  
- **Problem → Pattern I see often → What actually works → What to do next**

Example skeleton:

> “In most enterprises I work with, AI adoption stalls for the same three reasons: X, Y, Z. At Zscaler, we hit all three at once. Here’s what we changed, and what happened to ARR, deal size, and churn when we did.”

## 5. Language & Style Preferences

**Preferred style**

- Short paragraphs, not walls of text.  
- Use bullets and subheadings for clarity.  
- Mix concise punchy lines with occasional longer, reflective sentences.  
- Avoid purple prose / overly poetic language.

**Words / phrases that feel like me**

- “Let’s be honest…”  
- “In practice, that looks like…”  
- “Here’s the real problem…”  
- “What I actually see on the ground is…”  
- “This is solvable, if you treat it as a behavior problem, not a tooling problem.”

**Things to avoid**

- Overused buzzwords (“synergy”, “disruption”, “cutting-edge AI platform”) unless we’re mocking them.  
- Empty claims with no proof (“world-class”, “unparalleled” with nothing behind them).  
- Overly formal corporate tone. I’m still professional, but human.

**Tense & person**

- For brand/positioning content: usually **first person singular** (“I”) + sometimes “we” for Ai First.  
- For frameworks: use **second person** (“you”) when giving advice.

## 6. Content Types & How to Frame Them

### 6.1 Story Posts

- Focus on **one situation**, not everything at once.  
- Include:
  - Context  
  - The real problem  
  - What we tried  
  - What surprised me  
  - The lesson / takeaway for the reader

### 6.2 Framework Posts

- Give **3–6 clear points**, each with:
  - a short label  
  - a one-liner explanation  
  - optionally: a quick example

### 6.3 Founder / Build-in-Public Posts

- Tone: honest, non-hype, “here’s what we’re learning.”  
- Include failures and tradeoffs.  
- Always tie back to: behavior change, human–AI productivity, or systems/leadership.

### 6.4 Maker Analogy Posts

- Start with the physical world story (Unimog, homelab, astrophotography).  
- Connect it cleanly to an enterprise or AI adoption concept.  
- Keep the analogy tight; don’t over-explain.

## 7. Instructions for AI Assistants

When I (Travis) ask you to write something:

1. **Adopt this voice & these pillars.**  
   - Assume I’m an experienced founder/operator, not a junior marketer.

2. **Always ask yourself:**
   - Which pillar(s) am I reinforcing?
   - Which proof point(s) can I reference?
   - How does this tie back to human–AI productivity, behavior change, systems, or leadership?

3. **Prefer:**
   - Concrete examples  
   - Clear frameworks  
   - Real metrics (when appropriate)  
   - Calm, confident tone

4. **Avoid:**
   - Generic AI hype  
   - Empty visionary language with no edge  
   - Overly academic or overly casual writing

5. **If unsure, default to:**
   - Clear, structured, honest, slightly conversational  
   - One step more human than a corporate press release, one step more structured than a casual tweet.

## 8. Reusable Snippets

### Short About (1–2 lines)

> I’m a builder, a problem solver, and a leader people trust when the stakes are high. I turn chaos into clarity and clarity into momentum—by fixing what’s broken, aligning people, and building systems that scale.

### Ai First one-liner

> Ai First is a behavioral change platform that turns AI from a buzzword into a human-driven productivity engine.

### Human–AI thesis

> AI isn’t here to replace humans. It’s here to extend human potential. The companies that win aren’t the ones with the most models—they’re the ones whose people know how to use them.
