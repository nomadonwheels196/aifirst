- Visual: Split diagram showing disconnect between executives and frontline workers
- 5 key pain points in clean layout:
  - Executives strategize from above, insights stay in the trenches

  - Shadow AI grows faster than sanctioned adoption
  - Departments move at different speeds
  - Innovation trapped in labs, never reaches production

**SLIDE 4: What Ai First Is**
