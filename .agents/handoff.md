# Agent Handoff Notes

**Last Session:** 2025-11-15 02:04:54 UTC
**Agent:** Claude Code

## Session Summary

Completed comprehensive Ai-focused ontology document update: systematically rewrote Section 6 (Implementation Plan - all 4 phases), Appendix B (Ai use case template and example), Executive Overview, and performed full consistency review. Updated all references from generic 'roles/skills/tools/use cases' to Ai-specific constructs: personas (role+function+motivations+behaviors), Ai opportunities (where Ai creates leverage), Ai skills (prompting/evaluation/retrieval), Ai knowledge (LLM behavior/safety/prompt design), Ai tools (text generation/summarization/RAG), Ai use cases (smallest units of Ai-enabled work), and Ai workflows (chains of Ai-enabled steps). Updated Technical Recommendations section (API endpoints, database schemas), Risks/Tradeoffs, and Future Extensions. File: Product_and_Eng/Product_Management/Skill_Mapping_Claude/ontology_plan_knowledge_workers.md (1795 lines). All 10 tasks completed successfully.
