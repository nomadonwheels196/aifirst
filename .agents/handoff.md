# Agent Handoff Notes

**Last Session:** 2025-11-12 10:17:17 UTC
**Agent:** Claude Code

## Session Summary

Session Summary: Fixed session protocol documentation; archived and replaced Business_Spec with latest version.

Problems → Solutions:
- Missing "On Start" instruction in /Users/travis/CLAUDE.md → Added explicit session-open command with ⚠️ warning
- Outdated Business_Spec needed replacement → Archived to /Users/travis/Archive/Work/aifirst/Business_Spec_2025-11-12/ and copied new version from Downloads

Key Decisions:
- Standardized archive process: Use /Users/travis/Archive/Work/aifirst/ with timestamped subfolders (<FolderName>_YYYY-MM-DD)
- Session protocol now clearly states session-open must run at start of EVERY session

Files Touched:
- /Users/travis/CLAUDE.md (added session-open instruction)
- /Users/travis/Work/Ai_First/Business_Spec/ (all files replaced with new version)
- /Users/travis/Archive/Work/aifirst/Business_Spec_2025-11-12/ (created, contains old version)

Note: Transcript export not performed - Claude Code currently lacks conversation history export capability.
