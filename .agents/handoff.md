# Agent Handoff Notes

**Last Session:** 2025-11-12 17:37:13 UTC
**Agent:** Claude Code

## Session Summary

Session: Reorganize root directories and centralize utilities

Problems → Solutions:
- Root directory cluttered with data/, payloads/, scripts/, tools/, and Makefile → Investigated origin of each directory, moved to appropriate functional areas
- data/ and payloads/ were M2A pipeline working directories → Moved to Biz_Ops/Company_SOPs/Meeting-to-Action_M2A/
- scripts/ (check_conventions.sh, new_dir.sh, regen_readmes.py) were repo utilities → Moved to Biz_Ops/IT/scripts/
- tools/ (notion_sync_page.py) was Notion integration utility → Moved to Biz_Ops/IT/tools/
- Makefile (naming convention linter/fixer) was project-specific → Moved to ~/.agents/ for multi-project use
- 72+ files referenced old directory paths → Updated all references in .md, .sh, .py files

Key Decisions:
- Keep Examples/ at root (cross-functional, multi-audience content)
- Move operational tools to Biz_Ops/IT/ (IT owns repo infrastructure)
- Move M2A work artifacts to SOP directory (co-locate with process spec)
- Centralize Makefile in ~/.agents/ (reusable across all projects with DIR parameter)
- Updated CLAUDE.md with make lint/fix usage instructions

Deliverables:
- data/, payloads/ → Biz_Ops/Company_SOPs/Meeting-to-Action_M2A/
- scripts/, tools/ → Biz_Ops/IT/
- Makefile → ~/.agents/Makefile (with DIR parameter support)
- Updated 72+ markdown files with new scripts/new_dir.sh paths
- Updated shell scripts and Python scripts with new paths
- Updated CLAUDE.md with naming convention enforcement instructions
- Clean root directory (only Examples/, Business_Spec/, and functional areas remain)

Next: Root directory is now clean and well-organized with clear separation of concerns
