## Session Summary

Fixed session-close script for non-interactive AI use, reviewed and committed Gemini's cloudflared tunnel documentation, standardized all 12 agent instruction files across home/personal/work directories with session protocols and multi-agent coordination, added critical ...gitignore checks to prevent committing large ML models and cache files, updated ...gitignore with model file exclusions. Commits: personal repo (303751f, 61419d8), work repo (cc2a3ba, 62c6b8c). All agent files now have consistent session workflows and large-file warnings.
